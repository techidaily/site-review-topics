Let’s learn!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?"></a>Part 1.

However, here are the main ones:</p><h3 id="1-Protect-your-privacy"><a href="#1-Protect-your-privacy" class="headerlink" title="1. Protect your privacy"></a>1. Protect your privacy</h3><p>While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.</p><h3 id="2-Prank-your-friends"><a href="#2-Prank-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Prank your friends"></a>2. Prank your friends</h3><p>Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.</p><h3 id="3-Make-new-friends"><a href="#3-Make-new-friends" class="headerlink" title="3. Make new friends"></a>3. Make new friends</h3><p>As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location.

This way, all suggestions on the “People Nearby” feature will match your new GPS location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Now let’s learn how to fake location on Telegram using three simple methods.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Change-Telegram-location-on-Android-iOS-with-the-best-Location-Changer"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Telegram-location-on-Android-iOS-with-the-best-Location-Changer" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Change Telegram location on Android&#x2F; iOS with the best Location Changer"></a>Method 1: Change Telegram location on Android&#x2F; iOS with the best Location Changer</h3><p>If you want to completely varnish your location on Telegram, install a powerful GPS tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, a new feature called Geo-filters has brought a lot of mixed feelings amongst Snachatters.</p><p>The filter is location-based, which makes any content that you share to be seen by people who are within your geographic fence.</p><p>Imagine that you are standing at the Niagara Falls and want to share with people who are in Europe; you will not be able to do this and this is why the filters are problematic to people in the Snapchat community.</p><p>Thankfully, there are ways in which you can spoof our device, allowing you to access Geofilters anywhere in the world.

When Geofilters was introduced, it meant that you could only access filters that were designed for specific locations.</p><p>Sponsored filters generally tend to target people in certain areas, and this can limit how you disseminate your content on Snapchat.</p><p>The main benefit that you get from faking Snapchat is getting access to these filters without even moving an inch.</p><p>When you spoof your device, Snapchat thinks that you are actually in the area that you have spoofed to.

Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use -</strong> Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.</li><li><strong>Price –</strong> Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost. This makes it less-costly when it comes to performance and convenience.</li><li><strong>Security –</strong> XCode may not be very secure, especially when it comes to avoiding detection by Snapchat. You may have to keep going back to XCode, and changing the location, switching off Snapchat, and restating it again. However, when using iTools, your location is fixed until you stop the simulation.</li><li><strong>Versatility –</strong> XCode cannot be used on the latest iOS devices without posing problems, while iTools is a simple and effective tool for all iOS versions.</li></ul><h2 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h2><p>When you want to spoof Snapchat to access Geo-Filters in any part of the world, you can use the complicated XCode or pay a fee and use the simpler iTools.

However, a new feature called Geo-filters has brought a lot of mixed feelings amongst Snachatters.</p><p>The filter is location-based, which makes any content that you share to be seen by people who are within your geographic fence.</p><p>Imagine that you are standing at the Niagara Falls and want to share with people who are in Europe; you will not be able to do this and this is why the filters are problematic to people in the Snapchat community.</p><p>Thankfully, there are ways in which you can spoof our device, allowing you to access Geofilters anywhere in the world. Today, you learn several ways in which you can achieve this objective with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Benefits-that-faking-Snapchat-brings-to-us"><a href="#Part-1-Benefits-that-faking-Snapchat-brings-to-us" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Benefits that faking Snapchat brings to us"></a>Part 1: Benefits that faking Snapchat brings to us</h2><p>Snapchat comes with a lot of filters, both sponsored and crowdsourced, which you can use to interact with different people. When Geofilters was introduced, it meant that you could only access filters that were designed for specific locations.</p><p>Sponsored filters generally tend to target people in certain areas, and this can limit how you disseminate your content on Snapchat.</p><p>The main benefit that you get from faking Snapchat is getting access to these filters without even moving an inch.</p><p>When you spoof your device, Snapchat thinks that you are actually in the area that you have spoofed to. This virtual location will then allow you to access the filters that are available in that area.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-free-but-complicated-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-no-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-A-free-but-complicated-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-no-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A free but complicated way to fake Snapchat location no jailbreak"></a>Part 2: A free but complicated way to fake Snapchat location no jailbreak</h2><p>One of the best ways to fake Snapchat without jailbreak is to use XCode.

The iOS version today is very secure and you cannot tweak it like before.</p><p>Thankfully, you can use a premium, not free, iTools to change your virtual location without jailbreaking the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device. You can get iTools on a trial basis, but after the period expires, you will have to pay $30.95 to continue using it.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install iTools on your computer and then launch it. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the original USB cable that came with the Xiaomi Redmi 12 device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the iTools panel and click on “toolbox”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-1.jpg"                      alt="Select Toolbox in iTools"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the Virtual Location button within the Toolbox Panel</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-2.jpg"                      alt="select Virtual Location in Toolbox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Type in the location that you want to teleport to and then click on ‘Move Here”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-3.jpg"                      alt="Select your desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now open your Snapchat and you will be able to access the filters found in the location that you typed in.</p><p>Once you are finished with this spoofed location, you can simply select “Stop Simulation” in iTools. This is a premium tool, but very simple to use. It is the best tool to use, especially if you are having a device with the latest iOS version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-4.jpg"                      alt="stop simulation after you have finished with the new location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-A-brief-comparison-of-XCode-vs-iTools-to-fake-Snapchat-GPS-location"><a href="#Part-4-A-brief-comparison-of-XCode-vs-iTools-to-fake-Snapchat-GPS-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: A brief comparison of XCode vs. iTools to fake Snapchat GPS location"></a>Part 4: A brief comparison of XCode vs. iTools to fake Snapchat GPS location</h2><p>From the steps used in both methods, it is very clear that iTools is the best app to use to fake your Snapchat GPS location for several reasons. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use -</strong> Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.</li><li><strong>Price –</strong> Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost. This makes it less-costly when it comes to performance and convenience.</li><li><strong>Security –</strong> XCode may not be very secure, especially when it comes to avoiding detection by Snapchat. You may have to keep going back to XCode, and changing the location, switching off Snapchat, and restating it again. However, when using iTools, your location is fixed until you stop the simulation.</li><li><strong>Versatility –</strong> XCode cannot be used on the latest iOS devices without posing problems, while iTools is a simple and effective tool for all iOS versions.</li></ul><h2 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h2><p>When you want to spoof Snapchat to access Geo-Filters in any part of the world, you can use the complicated XCode or pay a fee and use the simpler iTools.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Allow WhatsApp access to your device’s location and then press the <strong>Share Live Location</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-2.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your location, add a comment, and tap the <strong>Send</strong> button. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device’s location and then share it on WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone"></a>Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone</h2><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone is the perfect tool to handle all your WhatsApp issues.

But you’ll have to sacrifice all your WhatsApp data. Luckily, Dr.Fone allows you to backup, restore, and transfer all WhatsApp data.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Backup WhatsApp Business chats</strong></li></ol><p>Having a WhatsApp Business account is vital if you’re an online marketer.

Just update and restart the app or check your location settings if it’s enabled. And, of course, use Dr.Fone to share a fake location on WhatsApp and perform other WhatsApp tasks like backing up and transferring data.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Allow WhatsApp access to your device’s location and then press the <strong>Share Live Location</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-2.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your location, add a comment, and tap the <strong>Send</strong> button. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device’s location and then share it on WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone"></a>Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone</h2><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone is the perfect tool to handle all your WhatsApp issues.

It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don’t expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don’t expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.</p><h3 id="2-What-happens-when-you-like-someone-on-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#2-What-happens-when-you-like-someone-on-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="2. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?"></a>2. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?</h3><p>If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person’s photo or hitting the love icon. Let’s elaborate on how you do either of the two.</p><p><strong>Sending a Like</strong></p><ul><li>Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.</li><li>From the choices displayed, select the “Dating” Option.</li><li>Tap the love icon to send the like.</li></ul><p><strong>Starting a conversation</strong></p><ul><li>Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.</li><li>From the choices displayed, select the “Dating” Option.</li><li>Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party. If you send them a like, they have to send a like back for a conversation to commence. But, equally important, the other person has to reply to your message for you to start a conversation.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-you-know-if-someone-is-on-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#3-How-do-you-know-if-someone-is-on-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?"></a>3. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?</h3><p>One must admit that knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating can be quite hard. After all, the feature automatically hides its users’ profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.</p><p>That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that’s a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn’t mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.</p><h3 id="4-Can-someone-see-once-you-read-a-message-sent-via-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#4-Can-someone-see-once-you-read-a-message-sent-via-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?"></a>4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?</h3><p>Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn’t support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.</p><h3 id="5-How-anonymous-is-a-Facebook-Dating-profile"><a href="#5-How-anonymous-is-a-Facebook-Dating-profile" class="headerlink" title="5. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?"></a>5. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?</h3><p>Seeing someone’s Facebook Dating profile can be a daunting task. Despite that being the case, anonymity is something you can’t expect from this platform. If someone gets lucky and sees your dating profile, recognizing you are pretty high. After all, your profile displays the name you use on Facebook.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It is an excellent way of meeting new friends who live outside your residence area. In addition to that, you can also use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake your location when using other social media platforms, games, and dating sites.

This app was established in 2013 and facilitates secure conversations among more than 550 active users. But despite its super-tight security, location-sharing on Telegram remains a concern among many. Like Facebook, the “People Nearby” feature on Telegram can expose your location to unwanted people. So, how can one create a <strong>fake GPS on Telegram</strong>? If you’re one of those concerned users, this post will teach you how to create a <strong>Telegram fake GPS</strong> quickly and easily. Let’s learn!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?"></a>Part 1. Why Fake Location on Telegram?</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to fake location on Telegram. However, here are the main ones:</p><h3 id="1-Protect-your-privacy"><a href="#1-Protect-your-privacy" class="headerlink" title="1. Protect your privacy"></a>1. Protect your privacy</h3><p>While signing up on Telegram, you’ll often allow the messaging app to track your GPS location. Unfortunately, this also applies to other messaging apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. Therefore, to prevent Telegram from accessing and sharing your real-time location, you’ll need to spoof GPS.</p><h3 id="2-Prank-your-friends"><a href="#2-Prank-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="2. Prank your friends"></a>2. Prank your friends</h3><p>Social media pressure is real. But instead of the negativity, you can concentrate on the prank side of it. For example, you might want to convince your close cousin or new girlfriend that you live and work in Las Vegas when you’re actually in Texas. Whichever the case, spoofing your location can give you a new social status.</p><h3 id="3-Make-new-friends"><a href="#3-Make-new-friends" class="headerlink" title="3. Make new friends"></a>3. Make new friends</h3><p>As said before, Telegram has a “People Nearby” feature for giving you friend recommendations based on your actual location. In addition, you can see Telegram groups near your GPS location. So, if you intend to go international and meet new friends, change your Telegram location. This way, all suggestions on the “People Nearby” feature will match your new GPS location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Send-Fake-Location-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Send Fake Location on Telegram?"></a>Part 2. How to Send Fake Location on Telegram?</h2><p>We are here to provide the three most-used methods for you to change location on Telegram. Not every solution is suitable for every situation that everyone encounters, but there is always one that is right for you. Some methods may require the assistance of a computer, some can be done only on a mobile phone, and the success rate varies greatly. Now let’s learn how to fake location on Telegram using three simple methods.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Change-Telegram-location-on-Android-iOS-with-the-best-Location-Changer"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Telegram-location-on-Android-iOS-with-the-best-Location-Changer" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Change Telegram location on Android&#x2F; iOS with the best Location Changer"></a>Method 1: Change Telegram location on Android&#x2F; iOS with the best Location Changer</h3><p>If you want to completely varnish your location on Telegram, install a powerful GPS tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

With a professional VPN service, you can change your device’s IP address and access international websites, TV stations, movie channels, and so on. In other words, it connects you to a computer server in a country where you’re typically restricted. Popular VPN services include NordVPN and ExpressVPN.</p><p>For example, let’s learn how to set up the ExpressVPPN service on Android&#x2F;iPhone:</p><ul><li>▪ Step 1. Download the VPN app on Google Play Store, launch it, and create an account.</li><li>▪ Step 2.

Recently, the malware was found in an app called <strong>System Update</strong>. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users’ devices to the operators’ servers. It’s important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history.

Fortunately, you are allowed to change the language on TikTok and access the content of that region. However, this method only shows the content of the selected area.</p><p>Therefore, you can’t add the language of any such region which has banned the application. Instead, follow the given steps to change your language on TikTok and access the content peacefully:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the TikTok application and select “Profile,” written on the lower right-hand corner of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/change-location-on-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on profile option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the three dots mentioned in the right-hand corner and access the “Settings and Privacy” of your TikTok account.

Therefore, it will be helpful if you buy a SIM card from another area and use it on Your Vivo V29 to watch that region’s content quickly. This process is as simple as choosing a fake location and buying a SIM card from that region.</p><p>You can do so by ordering an international SIM card through Amazon and putting your SIM in the mobile phone. Now, delete the cache and app data. Then, open TikTok and enjoy various content. Unfortunately, you will have to buy a phone with a dual SIM. Moreover, some SIM cards might not work in your region unless you buy a mobile plan.</p><h3 id="2-For-Computer"><a href="#2-For-Computer" class="headerlink" title="2. For Computer"></a>2.

If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.</p><p>However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.</p><p><strong>Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Tinder in your Vivo T2 Pro 5G as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/tinder+.jpg"                      alt="tinder plus"                ></p><h2 id="Top-7-Skype-Hacker-to-Hack-Any-Skype-Account-On-your-Vivo-T2-Pro-5G"><a href="#Top-7-Skype-Hacker-to-Hack-Any-Skype-Account-On-your-Vivo-T2-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="Top 7 Skype Hacker to Hack Any Skype Account On your Vivo T2 Pro 5G"></a>Top 7 Skype Hacker to Hack Any Skype Account On your Vivo T2 Pro 5G</h2><p>The rise in social media and online apps to communicate has made it easy to exchange information, emotions, and much more stuff which were not possible in earlier times.

However, a new feature called Geo-filters has brought a lot of mixed feelings amongst Snachatters.</p><p>The filter is location-based, which makes any content that you share to be seen by people who are within your geographic fence.</p><p>Imagine that you are standing at the Niagara Falls and want to share with people who are in Europe; you will not be able to do this and this is why the filters are problematic to people in the Snapchat community.</p><p>Thankfully, there are ways in which you can spoof our device, allowing you to access Geofilters anywhere in the world. Today, you learn several ways in which you can achieve this objective with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Benefits-that-faking-Snapchat-brings-to-us"><a href="#Part-1-Benefits-that-faking-Snapchat-brings-to-us" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Benefits that faking Snapchat brings to us"></a>Part 1: Benefits that faking Snapchat brings to us</h2><p>Snapchat comes with a lot of filters, both sponsored and crowdsourced, which you can use to interact with different people. When Geofilters was introduced, it meant that you could only access filters that were designed for specific locations.</p><p>Sponsored filters generally tend to target people in certain areas, and this can limit how you disseminate your content on Snapchat.</p><p>The main benefit that you get from faking Snapchat is getting access to these filters without even moving an inch.</p><p>When you spoof your device, Snapchat thinks that you are actually in the area that you have spoofed to. This virtual location will then allow you to access the filters that are available in that area.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-free-but-complicated-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-no-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-2-A-free-but-complicated-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-no-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A free but complicated way to fake Snapchat location no jailbreak"></a>Part 2: A free but complicated way to fake Snapchat location no jailbreak</h2><p>One of the best ways to fake Snapchat without jailbreak is to use XCode.

Remember that you can move from one location to the next on XCode without having to close Snapchat. Just cancel the current snap after changing the location and create a new snap to see the filters in the new location. If this fails to respond, then go back to Google maps or iOS map app and then ensure that you are in the desired location. Once you have done so, close Snapchat and restart it again, and you will be in the new location once more.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-paid-but-easy-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-without-jailbreak"><a href="#Part-3-A-paid-but-easy-way-to-fake-Snapchat-location-without-jailbreak" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: A paid but easy way to fake Snapchat location without jailbreak"></a>Part 3: A paid but easy way to fake Snapchat location without jailbreak</h2><p>You can also fake your Snapchat GPS location using a premium app such as iTools.

The iOS version today is very secure and you cannot tweak it like before.</p><p>Thankfully, you can use a premium, not free, iTools to change your virtual location without jailbreaking the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device. You can get iTools on a trial basis, but after the period expires, you will have to pay $30.95 to continue using it.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install iTools on your computer and then launch it. Connect your iOS device to your computer using the original USB cable that came with the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the iTools panel and click on “toolbox”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-1.jpg"                      alt="Select Toolbox in iTools"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the Virtual Location button within the Toolbox Panel</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-2.jpg"                      alt="select Virtual Location in Toolbox"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Type in the location that you want to teleport to and then click on ‘Move Here”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/itools-3.jpg"                      alt="Select your desired location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now open your Snapchat and you will be able to access the filters found in the location that you typed in.</p><p>Once you are finished with this spoofed location, you can simply select “Stop Simulation” in iTools.

Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use -</strong> Using XCode to fake your Snapchat GPS location is a long and complicated process, whereas using iTools is simple and clean.</li><li><strong>Price –</strong> Although XCode is free while iTools is not, the benefits of using iTools surpass the cost.

The article will help you learn <strong>how to change your TikTok location</strong> by presenting the following aspects:</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-TikTok-Detect-your-Location"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-TikTok-Detect-your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location"></a>Part 1: How Does TikTok Detect your Location</h2><p>According to the TikTok privacy policy, your location through TikTok is tracked based on your IP address, SIM card, and GPS. It happens right after you make your account on TikTok through your phone number. In this way, TikTok also happens to avoid scammers and fraudsters. In some cases, your location is also automatically tracked by giving a location tag to your posts.</p><p>The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as “Technical Information.” In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.</p><p>Your information becomes easily accessible to everyone. Moreover, it is also mentioned in the privacy statement of TikTok that they will share your details with public authorities, enforcement agencies, and other organizations. TikTok can share your sensitive information with governments and commercial parties.</p><p>If you don’t want to add your location on TikTok, you will have to deny the permissions on your phone. Hence, knowing how to change location on TikTok is necessary.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-We-Need-to-Change-Location-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-Why-We-Need-to-Change-Location-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok"></a>Part 2: Why We Need to Change Location on TikTok</h2><p>We have discussed how TikTok gets to know about your location in the first part. Now, we will share why do we need to <strong>change location on TikTok:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>To Add Diversity to the Audience</strong></li></ul><p>The algorithm of TikTok is built so that it will only show the content of your region or country. Therefore, if you want to make money through your content on TikTok, it might not be possible for you. So, you may want to target the audience of another region that is willing to buy the content.</p><ul><li><strong>Access Better Content</strong></li></ul><p>Even if TikTok offers exciting content that has made the app popular, you can only access the available content for your region. Therefore, if you want to enjoy more content from the other areas, you should <strong>change your location on TikTok</strong> to access unlimited content.</p><ul><li><strong>Use the App without Hurdles</strong></li></ul><p>Countries like Afghanistan and India have banned the TikTok application, and Indonesia and Bangladesh have censored it. Moreover, the United States is also thinking of the same due to user privacy concerns and security threats. However, if your country has already banned TikTok, you can still access the content with a fake location if you know how to change location in TikTok.</p><ul><li><strong>Protect your Privacy</strong></li></ul><p>If you are not using a VPN or any other way to change your location, TikTok can access your device easily. The organization behind TikTok can access the applications on your phone, your messages, and places you go to. So, when you change your location, it will remove the chances of being tracked.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-your-Location-in-TikTok-on-Different-Devices"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-your-Location-in-TikTok-on-Different-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change your Location in TikTok on Different Devices?"></a>Part 3: How to Change your Location in TikTok on Different Devices?</h2><p>We have discussed why it is essential to know how to change the location of TikTok.

One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else’s mobile phone or device.</p><p>Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees’ devices or kids’ phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are <strong>mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker</strong>, etc.</p><p>The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don’t worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.</p><h3 id="How-to-Detect-mSpy-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Detect-mSpy-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices"></a>How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices</h3><p>For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that’ll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings.

Download history on the App Store"></a>1. Download history on the App Store</h4><p>Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called <strong>System Update</strong>. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users’ devices to the operators’ servers. It’s important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Tecno Pop 7 Pro.</p><h4 id="2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage"><a href="#2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage" class="headerlink" title="2.

Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user’s average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.</p><h4 id="3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera"><a href="#3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3.

On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Tecno Pop 7 Pro’s camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.</p><h4 id="4-Increased-Device-Shut-Down-Time"><a href="#4-Increased-Device-Shut-Down-Time" class="headerlink" title="4.

But sometimes, you might want to <strong>change location on Viber</strong> to prank your friends or for security purposes. So, read on to learn how to <strong>fake location on Viber</strong> with some simple solutions.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-My-Location-feature-on-Viber"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-My-Location-feature-on-Viber" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?"></a>Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?</h2><p>If you’ve used WhatsApp’s location feature before, you’ll know what Viber’s “My Location” is all about. With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.</p><p>But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Tecno Pop 7 Pro&#x2F;Android browser. Therefore, you can send a location on Viber without knowing. This can be advantageous to stalkers or even cause misunderstanding in your relationship. What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send.

It’s straightforward.</p><p>Step 1. Fire up your Viber app on mobile or PC and tap the <strong>Chats</strong> button. Here, proceed to open a chat that you want to enable&#x2F;disable location sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-1.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber open chats"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> (three dots) icon at the top-right corner of the screen and choose <strong>Chat Info</strong>. Alternatively, simply swipe the screen to the left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-2.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber, tap chat info"                ></p><p>Step 3. On the Chat Info window, simply enable or disable the <strong>Attach location always</strong> toggle. It’s done!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-3.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber to allow location sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: You might be wondering how to share your actual Viber location with a chat or group. Again, this is very straightforward. Simply open the conversation and tap the three dots on the text field. Then, click the <strong>Share Location</strong> button and choose your location on the Google map. Lastly, tap <strong>Send location</strong> to share the Viber location with your selected contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber share location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?"></a>Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?</h2><p>So, is it possible to <strong>Viber’s fake location</strong>? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
