Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="Life360-Circle-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-On-Realme-Narzo-60-Pro-5G"><a href="#Life360-Circle-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-On-Realme-Narzo-60-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G"></a>Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G</h2><p>In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups.

But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they’re going when driving.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Life360-Circle-Works"><a href="#Part-2-How-Life360-Circle-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?"></a>Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?</h2><p>Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers.

You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-The-Meaning-Of-Circle-Colors-In-Life360"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-The-Meaning-Of-Circle-Colors-In-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?"></a>Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?</h2><p>Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles&#x2F;bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle’s color. The app’s primary colors are purple, orange, and green.</p><p>It’s important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they’ve been up to.</p><p>The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member’s recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.</p><p>The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-happens-when-you-join-a-Circle-on-Life360"><a href="#Part-4-What-happens-when-you-join-a-Circle-on-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?"></a>Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?</h2><p>As soon as you’ve set up your Circle, no one else will be on it.

Upon successful connection, press the “Get Started” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="tap on get started button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Following that, you’ll see an area map. You’ll be able to know where you are right now if you use this feature. The “Center On” symbol may be found in the bottom right of the screen if the location isn’t appropriately shown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="choose destination"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The three life360 symbols at the upper right of the screen are visible. Activating the Teleport Mode requires you to tap on the third icon. Click “Go” when ready to go to your desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="choose destination you want"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> When you input a new location, the application monitors and assesses it. A new box will immediately emerge at the location where the distance is specified. Choosing “Move Here” will cause your current location to be updated to reflect the new place you’ve picked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="tap on move here button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Delete-Leave-a-Life360-Circle"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Delete-Leave-a-Life360-Circle" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Delete&#x2F;Leave a Life360 Circle?"></a>Part 6: How to Delete&#x2F;Leave a Life360 Circle?</h2><p>Getting rid of a Circle is a cinch!

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme 11 Pro to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-nokia-c300-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Nokia C300? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-use-device-manager-to-reinstall-your-drivers-in-windows-11-and-10-and-7-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>How to use Device Manager to reinstall your drivers in Windows 11 & 10 & 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-iphone-xr-screen-lock-without-password-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/"><u>How to unlock iPhone XR screen lock without password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-gps-location-on-xiaomi-civi-3-disney-100th-anniversary-edition-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change GPS Location on Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition Easily & Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/remove-google-frp-lock-on-meizu-21-pro-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>Remove Google FRP Lock on Meizu 21 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-htc-u23-pro-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>How to unlock HTC U23 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-life360-notify-when-you-log-out-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-reviving-dull-images-the-most-effective-10-web-editing-aids/"><u>[New] Reviving Dull Images  The Most Effective 10 Web Editing Aids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-iphone-15-passcode-not-working-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Fix iPhone 15 Passcode not Working?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-mix-of-soundtracks-and-visuals-adding-srt-to-mp4/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Mix of Soundtracks and Visuals  Adding SRT to MP4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-spin-original-web-jokes-for-sharing/"><u>2024 Approved  Spin Original Web Jokes for Sharing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-counter-image-navigation-in-digital-age-a-facebook-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering Counter-Image Navigation in Digital Age  A Facebook Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/updated-from-snapshots-to-cinematic-masterpiece-a-video-creation-guide/"><u>Updated From Snapshots to Cinematic Masterpiece A Video Creation Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-oppo-find-n3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does find my friends work on Oppo Find N3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-art-of-audio-branding-creating-iconic-podcast-cover-imagery/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Art of Audio Branding Creating Iconic Podcast Cover Imagery</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Poco-M6-5G"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Poco-M6-5G" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Poco M6 5G"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Poco M6 5G</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen.

If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-GT-5-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-GT-5-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme GT 5 Pro"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme GT 5 Pro</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme GT 5 Pro to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen.

So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="Does-Airplane-Mode-Turn-off-GPS-Location-On-Realme-GT-5"><a href="#Does-Airplane-Mode-Turn-off-GPS-Location-On-Realme-GT-5" class="headerlink" title="Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Realme GT 5?"></a>Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Realme GT 5?</h2><p>Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Realme GT 5 devices.

You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Realme GT 5 to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="set the location"                ></p><p>One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-iphone-15-to-other-iphone-15-pro-max-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-data-from-ios-transfer-data-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer Data From iPhone 15 To Other iPhone 15 Pro Max devices?

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you.

If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option.

If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method.

Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Samsung-Galaxy-A05"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Samsung-Galaxy-A05" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Samsung Galaxy A05"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Samsung Galaxy A05</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region.

Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Samsung Galaxy A05 to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme 12+ 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Realme-12-5G"><a href="#Will-iSpoofer-update-On-Realme-12-5G" class="headerlink" title="Will iSpoofer update On Realme 12+ 5G"></a>Will iSpoofer update On Realme 12+ 5G</h2><p>iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer shut down pic"                ></p><p>All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Can’t-I-update-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?"></a>Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not able to log in pic"                ></p><p>To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer error message pic"                ></p><p>Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.</p><p>Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="Ispoofer account suspension pic"                ></p><p>The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far</p><p>Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-Is-there-a-good-alternative-for-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?"></a>Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?</h2><p>There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.</p><p><strong>VPNs -</strong> There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="VPNs-pic-5"                ></p><p>Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg"                      alt="Google-play-store-apps-pic-6"                ></p><p>The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> You can use the <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html" >Dr.Fone Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer for both Android and iPhones.

And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme C33 2023 to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Poco-F5-Pro-5G"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Poco-F5-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Poco F5 Pro 5G"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Poco F5 Pro 5G</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Poco F5 Pro 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="3uTools-Virtual-Location-Not-Working-On-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Fix-Now"><a href="#3uTools-Virtual-Location-Not-Working-On-Poco-F5-Pro-5G-Fix-Now" class="headerlink" title="3uTools Virtual Location Not Working On Poco F5 Pro 5G?

This is because 3uTools is unable to establish a connection with the Google Maps API. Additionally, if your internet connection is unreliable, this may happen.</p><p>There isn’t much you can do if this is the reason why your <strong>3uTools virtual location isn’t working</strong> this is a technical problem that can only be fixed by a technical expert. You could try restarting 3uTools and performing the spoofing process again to update it. You might also try switching to “Mapbox” and see if it solves the issue.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the possible working solutions for the 3utools Virtual Location Not Working problem.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-3uTools-VirtualLocation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-3uTools-VirtualLocation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is 3uTools VirtualLocation?"></a>Part 1: What is 3uTools VirtualLocation?</h2><p>A program that can help someone manage their device is known as 3uTools.

Solving the internet issues"></a>1. Solving the internet issues</h3><p>Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.</p><p>If this is the cause of your <strong>3uTools virtual location not working</strong>, there isn’t much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to “Mapbox” to see if it addresses the problem.</p><h3 id="2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software"><a href="#2-Restarting-and-Closing-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. Restarting and Closing the Software"></a>2. Restarting and Closing the Software</h3><p>When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="restart the software"                ></p><h3 id="3-3uTools-reinstallation"><a href="#3-3uTools-reinstallation" class="headerlink" title="3. 3uTools reinstallation"></a>3. 3uTools reinstallation</h3><p>The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation.

As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="reinstall 3utools"                ></p><h3 id="4-Restarting-Your-Computer"><a href="#4-Restarting-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="4.

Whether you want to maintain your privacy, simulate being in a different place, or have other reasons for altering your Life360 location, this guide is here to help. We will explore the reasons why you might consider spoofing your Life360 location and provide you with step-by-step instructions on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>fake your location on Life360</strong> on both iPhone and Android devices. Let’s delve into the world of location spoofing and regain control of your whereabouts.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Life360"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Life360?"></a>Part 1: What is Life360?</h2><p>Life360 is one of the admired apps known for tracking location. The app can be used as a location-sharing platform as well as you can chat with your friends via the in-app chat feature. Here are the basics. All this app suggests is that a group of people whether an office projects group or simply a college team or maybe the family members, download and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/life360/" >install Life360 on their phones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Mind that the app supports iPhone and Android (6 and above) devices.</p><p>After the app gets installed, you can create a circle, which in other languages simply means a group, just like you create on Facebook or WhatsApp. This circle is having members who can share the information and location accountability with each other. You can also give invitations to other users by simply taking the help of their contact numbers or email addresses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/life360-intro.jpg"                      alt="life360 app"                ></p><p>Using this app then, you can simply see the location of the other members as well as get notifications named Place Alerts. These notifications will tell you whether a user has arrived or left the selected location. This can be helpful if you are a parent and want your children to reach safely at a desired place.</p><p>Moreover, with the help of Life360, a user can easily control the ‘Check-in’ according to which he or she sends the alert to the circle to know them the exact location. You can also get to see the location history of the members to know their past locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Do-People-Hate-Being-Tracked-by-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?"></a>Part 2: Why Do People Hate Being Tracked by Life360?</h2><p>Unarguably Life360 can be considered one of the most helpful and fun apps. But the thing that sometimes or many times might bother people is the 24x7 interference with privacy.</p><p>For instance, spouses can monitor their better half and if any one of them does not understand enough, they can put various questions for your particular location and it may create chaos as a result. Not just it has a negative aspect, but it is possible that you are organizing a surprise for your partner, and for its execution; you are simply heading to a particular place. Having Life360 and being tracked by it can simply spoil the surprise as well.</p><p>For these reasons, a lot of people sum up the app as an intervention for their privacy. And for those who love their privacy, hating being tracked by Life360 is completely natural to them.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360"><a href="#Part-3-Stop-Life360-Tracking-vs-Spoofing-Life360" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360"></a>Part 3: Stop Life360 Tracking vs. Spoofing Life360</h2><p>To stop or to spoof, that is the question! Yes, when you are annoyed with being tracked by Life360, you can have two options with you. Either you can stop Life360 tracking or spoof Life360 tracking. But what goes best? You might be wondering the same. For many of you, simply stopping the app and logging out from it can be a plain solution. However, we don’t support this. To us, the faking location on Life360 is much better.</p><ul><li>This is because firstly, if you log out and completely stop using the app, your members will get a notification for the same. To this, their curiosity will arise and none of them will stop questioning from you. To avoid this, we suggest spoofing Life360 location and not stopping it.</li><li>Secondly, this may be fun as you can show off to your friends that you are traveling somewhere else. The list of friends may include those who are jealous of you. And this is the best way to double up their jealousy.</li><li>Thirdly, if you tell the actual location of your device every time, many of the members, who are not having good intentions, can trace your routine and anything wrong can happen to you. Spoofing location can be a good way to trick them and catch their intentions.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Fake your Life360 location to any other address you require with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

Well! You can go for a spoofing app for this too. There are lots of them available at the Google Play Store. For more clarity, we will help you know how you can use a spoofer app for Life360 fake location. Make sure to go along with the steps carefully.</p><p>Before you get the app worked, here is a requirement you need to follow. The requirement simply says you to enable the developer options in your Poco F5 Pro 5G. If you know how to do it, it’s good. But if you don’t here are the steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open “Settings” in the first place and tap on “System”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-1.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, you need to go to the “About Phone” option. Followed by this, head to “Software info”.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will find the build number of your device here. You have to tap on it nearly 7 times.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/developer-options-2.jpg"                      alt="build number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, enter the lock code when asked and the developer options will be enabled.</p><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Guide-on-how-to-fake-your-location-on-Life360-with-Android-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer"></a>Step by Step Guide on how to fake your location on Life360 with Android Spoofer</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Now that you have turned on the developer options, you can visit the Play Store and look for Fake GPS Location app. Install it on your phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, again go to “Settings” &gt; “System” &gt; “Developer Options”.

This simply stands to have an extra phone with you and you can call it a burner phone. To have it, of course, you don’t have to spend much. Just have a cheap Android or iOS device with you. With this, you can easily trick your friends about your location.</p><ul><li>Now, all you have to do is to log out of the Life360 app from your main iPhone&#x2F;Android.</li><li>Install the app on the secondary or the burner phone and log in with the same account you were using on the original phone.</li><li>There is nothing more to it. You can now abandon this burner phone and leave it for your work. This will make your friends or near ones think where you want them to show your location.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> As we have mentioned in the beginning, Life360 supports an inbuilt chat function. This is where the downside comes of having a burner phone as a solution. Putting simply, you may miss an important conversation if you have the app on a burner phone and you have left it at home when any of your friends try to chat with you. And this can cause doubts in their minds.</p><h3 id="6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings"><a href="#6-2-Pause-Location-Sharing-in-Life360-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings"></a>6.2 Pause Location Sharing in Life360 Settings</h3><p>Here is another way to stop Life360 from tracking you. You can simply pause the location-sharing option from the settings. Let us mention the steps without any more discussion.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> At the lower right corner, hit on “Settings”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-1.jpg"                      alt="settings of Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the Circle Switcher at the top and pick out the circle you wish not to share locations with.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hit on “Location Sharing”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-2.jpg"                      alt="go to Location Sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lastly, toggle off the slider and it will turn grey. You will see a message saying “Location Sharing Paused” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/pause-location-sharing-3.jpg"                      alt="pause location sharing for Life360"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you disable or pause location for a particular group, your location can still be tracked by other circles. Make sure to choose all or as per your needs.</p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><ol><li><strong>How do I delete my history on Life360?</strong></li></ol><p>While it is technically possible, the method to accomplish this is improbable in yielding the intended outcome. Essentially, the sole means to entirely erase your history is by either deleting your Life360 account or departing from the Circle. Merely turning off your GPS or data connection on your phone won’t suffice.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Can I fake location without jailbreaking my iPhone?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, it’s possible to fake your location on an iPhone without jailbreaking using third-party tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool allows you to simulate GPS movement and set a fake location on your iPhone without needing to jailbreak the Poco F5 Pro 5G device. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, users can easily change their GPS location to any desired spot.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>How to spoof the actual movement from one place to the fake location?</strong></li></ol><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a tool that allows users to spoof actual movement from one place to another fake location on an iPhone. By using its features, users can simulate movement along a specified route, imitating real-life GPS movement from one location to another.</p><ol start="4"><li> <strong>If I turn off the Wi-Fi on my iPhone, will Life360 stop tracking me?</strong></li></ol><p>Disabling Wi-Fi on your iPhone might limit the accuracy of your location for Life360. However, Life360 can still track your location using cellular data and GPS. Turning off Wi-Fi alone might not entirely stop Life360 from tracking your location. It is especially true if other location services are still active on your device. To prevent tracking, you might need to adjust settings within your device’s location services.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Life360 is no doubt a useful app that can help you know about the whereabouts of your near friends and family. However, when you hate being tracked on it, spoofing Life360 can come out as a great option. We discussed some helpful ways <strong>how to fake your location on Life360</strong> in this article, including <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which allows you to manipulate your GPS location, simulate routes, and set up geofences, making it a versatile solution for your location spoofing needs.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method.

You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme GT Neo 5 SE to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal.

The app allows people to create a family group and stay connected to each other through features like chatting, sharing location, sending safety alerts, etc.</p><p>As of now, you cannot run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> as it is only available for Android and iOS. <em>Why?</em> Because as opposed to a PC, one can easily carry their device everywhere! It means whether your kid is stuck in traffic and needs your help or your parents have lost their way back home, Life360 will instantly send you an alert on your device.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean you cannot use Life360 on a PC. While it may seem a bit odd, there are a couple of methods that’ll allow you to get the <strong><em>Life360 app for Windows</em></strong>. In today’s guide, we are going to share some of these methods that’ll help you run the <strong><em>Life360 app on Windows</em></strong>.</p><p>So, without wasting another second, let’s dive straight into the guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Why-people-seek-to-use-Life360-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?"></a>Part 1: Why people seek to use Life360 on PC?</h2><p>First things first; why would anyone want to use a family locator app like Life360 on their PC? Well, the truth is everyone has their own reason to get <strong><em>Life360 for PC</em></strong>. For instance, let’s say you are in the middle of an important project and don’t want to be bothered by alerts on your smartphone. However, you still don’t want to compromise with the safety of your family members.</p><p>In this situation, you can simply run the <strong><em>Life360 app on PC</em></strong>. This will allow you to directly keep track of the whereabouts of family members on your Windows system and you won’t have to constantly check your phone.</p><p>Life360 can also be used on a computer when your phone’s battery has completely drained and there’s no power outlet nearby. In this case, you can simply power-on your laptop, start the Life360 app and send your current whereabouts to family members.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Is-it-possible-to-use-Life360-on-Windows-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?"></a>Part 2: Is it possible to use Life360 on Windows PC?</h2><p>Life360 is an extremely useful app for people who are always concerned about their closed ones. The app is basically designed with a vision to keep family members connected and safe. In addition to location sharing, the app also provides exclusive features like crash detection, place alerts, speed alerts, battery monitoring, etc.</p><p>The app also makes it easier for parents to monitor their child’s movement. Using the app, you can always know that your kids have safely reached school and back home. For any parent, knowing whether the kids are safe, is one less thing to worry about.</p><p>However, as we mentioned earlier, Life360 hasn’t been released for Windows yet. So, there’s no direct way to install and <strong><em>run the app on a Windows PC</em></strong>. While Life360 may release a dedicated Windows software in the future, as of now, you can only run it using the alternative methods.</p><p>These methods include:</p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Life360-on-Windows-PC-with-Android-emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator"></a>Part 3: Use Life360 on Windows PC with Android emulator</h2><p>The first and the most convenient way to run <strong><em>Life360 on computer</em></strong> is to use an Android Emulator. An emulator is basically a software that creates a virtual Android system on your computer. As a result, you’ll be able to run Android apps on your computer.</p><p>While there are dozens of Android emulators, Bluestacks seems to be the most popular and user-friendly option among all. Unlike other emulators, Bluestacks is easy to set up and use.</p><p>Here’s how you can run <strong><em>Life360 on a computer</em></strong> using Bluestacks Android emulator.&#x2F;</p><p>Step 1: Head over to Bluestacks official website and tap the download button.</p><p>Step 2: Open the installer and tap the “download” button.

For instance, running an Android emulator is not easy when you have a low-configuration PC. Emulators like Bluestacks requires high system configuration otherwise they take forever to load.</p><p>In this situation, we have another alternative for you to run <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>. You can simply mirror your Android to your Windows system. Mirroring the Android device will allow you to see its content on the PC itself.</p><p>Here’s how you can mirror the Android device on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Make sure that Bluetooth is activated on both devices.</p><p>Step 2: On your Windows PC, open “Settings” and select the “Systems” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-1.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 1"                ></p><p>Step 3: Choose the “Projecting to this PC” option in the left menu-bar and make sure that “Available Everywhere” is selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-2.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 2"                ></p><p>Step 4: If you’re running Android Pie or above on your device, scroll down to open notification drawer and select “Smart View” (or “Cast” in some devices). You’ll see your PC listed here. Tap the button to start Android mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-3.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 3"                ></p><p>Step 5: It may take some while for the connection to establish. Once it does, you’ll be able to cast your device screen onto your computer and you’ll be able to run life360 on your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/mirroring-android-4.jpg"                      alt="mirroring android 4"                ></p><p>Keep in mind that you’ll still require your device to navigate through the content on your computer. Any action that you perform on your device will be replicated on your computer screen as well.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Life360 is probably among the top family locators for Android users. Apart from its extensive range of features, the app provides a user-friendly interface, which allows it easier for even elders to use the app without any issues. Even though there isn’t a dedicated Life360 software for Windows, you can follow the above-mentioned methods to run the <strong><em>Life360 on PC</em></strong>.</p><h2 id="You-Might-Also-Like"><a href="#You-Might-Also-Like" class="headerlink" title="You Might Also Like"></a>You Might Also Like</h2><h2 id="Location-based-apps"><a href="#Location-based-apps" class="headerlink" title="Location-based apps"></a>Location-based apps</h2><p>GPS spoof for dating apps</p><p>GPS spoof for social apps</p><p>Pokemon Go on PC</p><p>AR game tricks</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/06/virtual-location-horizontal.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Change Phone GPS Location Easily</strong></p><ul><li>● Teleport GPS location to anywhere</li><li>● Play AR games without moving</li><li>● Spoof Location on the popular Apps</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Try Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-your-messages-after-100-pro-has-been-deleted-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Recover your messages after 100 Pro has been deleted</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-oppo-a18-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Oppo A18?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-Narzo-N55"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-Narzo-N55" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme Narzo N55"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme Narzo N55</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme Narzo N55 to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-V30T"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-V30T" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme V30T"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme V30T</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme V30T to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page.

And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="A-Detailed-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Review-On-Realme-V30T"><a href="#A-Detailed-VPNa-Fake-GPS-Location-Free-Review-On-Realme-V30T" class="headerlink" title="A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Realme V30T"></a>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Realme V30T</h2><p>As I stumbled upon this query that has been recently posted on a leading online forum, I realized that so many people don’t know about the VPNa Fake GPS app. If you are also an Android user who would like to change your device’s location, then VPNa Fake GPS APK might meet your requirements.

Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with “routes’ ‘ or “joystick” added. I wouldn’t mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn’t. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn’t working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn’t have import &amp; export or a joystick. Import &amp; export wouldn’t be important if reliable.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>Douglas Buell</td><td><em>This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the “no ads’ ‘ mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I’m immediately shown an ad the instant I’ve clicked the message “Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!” Why include a feature that doesn’t work? To force us to watch an ad you didn’t have to work for? Ridiculous.</em></td><td>1.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr><tr><td>Google Play Store</td><td>A Google User</td><td><em>Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say. It’s not difficult, but My Realme V30T keeps reinstalling the update, so I have to undo it. If you have an old phone where you won’t be using google maps, set it up there, and you’re all set. Follow the instructions step by step, and it works.</em></td><td>4.0&#x2F;5.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-5-Fake-GPS-Location-Spoofer-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use.

If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly.

Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Poco F5 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change.

You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="Life360-Circle-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-On-Poco-F5-5G"><a href="#Life360-Circle-Everything-You-Need-to-Know-On-Poco-F5-5G" class="headerlink" title="Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Poco F5 5G"></a>Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Poco F5 5G</h2><p>In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups.

Whenever you add a post to your stories, your bitmoji appears on the geo-tagged location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/snap-map-feature-pic1.jpg"                      alt="snap map feature"                ></p><p>This feature was good news for people who were wondering how to share location on snapchat with their friends. But there is more to this than your eyes are seeing. Even when you don’t upload any posts to the stories, snapchat is still revealing your location to all your friends, whether you want it or not. Everytime you open the app, your location is being compromised. You just need to agree to share your location once, and Snapchat takes it as an invite to share your location every single time you send a snap or simply open the app to look at others’ snaps.</p><p>This is very dangerous when you have unknown people on your snap friends list. You must have accidentally accepted requests from people who have similar names to your friends? You don’t really know the identity of the person unless they snap their faces to you. In the worst case scenario, you can also have an obsessed stalker who was just waiting for this chance to track you down.  The possibilities are endless. So, how to hide your snapchat location from the others on the internet? Our guide will teach you exactly that!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-Can-we-Hide-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?"></a><strong>Part 1: Can we Hide Location on Snapchat?</strong></h2><p>The first thing that comes to our mind whenever we think about fake gps location snapchat is a VPN. But keeping these virtual network apps and spoofing apps aside, is it possible to hide our location by taking advantage of the existing settings on the app?</p><p>Yes, Absolutely!</p><p>There are a few tricks that you can use to hide your location from your friends or anyone who you have on your Snap List.</p><p><strong>Ghost Mode:</strong> The word ‘Ghost’ was never this sweet. The snapchat fake location saves a lot of trouble. However, if there is no location at all, that is a huge advantage too! You can literally disappear off of the map when you activate the Ghost mode on Snapchat. Instead of a snapchat spoof, you are completely removing your traces from the Snapmap. This is how you enable this very useful setting -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are someone who maintains the snap streak regularly, then it is no problem for you to track down the camera screen. Open the camera screen on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/camera-screen-snapchat-pic2.jpg"                      alt="track camera screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the top-left corner, you will find your bitmoji that will lead you to your Snap profile. Click on your bitmoji.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/top-left-bitmoji-icon-pic3.jpg"                      alt="find bitmoji"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The profile page will appear. Scroll to the bottom and you will find the Snapmap option there. Right below it will be a small arrow pointing to the right. Instead of clicking on the map, tap on thi arrow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-settings-snapchat-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location setting on snapchat"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Map and ‘My Location’ settings will open. There you will find the Ghost Mode. Enable the setting and you will see a dialogue box asking you to choose the duration of the Ghost Mode. Depending on what you want, choose your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/ghost-mode-duration-pic5.jpg"                      alt="duration ghost mode"                ></p><p>If you still don’t trust this Ghost mode, the next trick will be very useful for you. Not just Snapchat, any app won’t be able to track down your exact location when you follow it.</p><p><strong>Turn Off GPS Permissions on your phone</strong></p><p>If you completely turn off the GPS Permissions on your phone, then no app can access your location even if you are connected to the internet. This might hinder the performance of a few apps but that is the risk that you must take to safeguard your privacy. The procedure to Turn off the GPS will differ from Android to iPhone. We have listed the most easy ways to turn off the location services on your phones.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>The easiest method is to go with the Notification tray that is present on top of the Android device. That is, when you look at your Android screen, you will see the notification tray on the top.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Swipe down the notification tray and you will find several options. One of them is the ‘Location’ icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-notifications-tray-android-pic6.jpg"                      alt="check location notification tray"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: The ‘Location’ icon is shaped like a geo-coordinate pin and remains in grey color when switched off and Blue color when turned on. Tap on the icon to on&#x2F;off.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-tap-on-to-change-pic7.jpg" alt="tap location on/off"></p><p><strong>iPhone</strong></p><p>To turn off the Location on your iPhone device,</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ‘Settings’ option from your iPhone device’s Menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/settings-iphone-menu-pic8.jpg"                      alt="go to setting on iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search for the ‘Privacy’ option and tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/privacy-option-for-iphone-location-pic9.jpg"                      alt="tap privacy option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the next page that appears, you will find the ‘Location Services’. If we are not wrong, it is usually the first option on the page that opens up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/location-services-option-pic10.jpg"                      alt="click location services option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Shift the toggle and turn off the Location Services. If you want, you can also disable location services individually for Snapchat only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/turn-off-location-services-pic11.jpg"                      alt="turn off location service"                ></p><p>These are the simple ways in which you can prevent snapchat from spying on your location. You must be knowing how to send location on snapchat through chats - even this won’t be possible once you completely turn off the GPS of your devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Spoof-Location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Spoof Location on Snapchat</strong></h2><p>If you are wondering how to fake location on snapchat, then the Snapchat location spoofer is one of the best options. You won’t find a specific software designed exclusively for Snapchat but Wondershare’s Dr. Fone Virtual Location spoofer will help you hide your real location on social media apps. This is how you use the application.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Dr.Fone Virtual Location Spoofer on your PC and launch it. You will find several options on the page. Go for ‘Virtual Location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/drfone-home-pic12.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now connect Your Poco F5 5G to your PC and go with the ‘Get Started’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: The world map with your current location will show up on the page. The ‘Teleport mode’ is the third icon on the top-right corner of the page. Click on it and enter your new location in the search box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you’ve decided with your final virtual location to fake gps for snapchat, then click on ‘Move Here’. New location will update in your phone and Snapchat will detect it too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="set the location"                ></p><p>One of the advantages of using a location spoofer is that - your new location will reflect in all social media applications. Even your regular apps will detect the change and note it. So, it becomes hard to know if the change is fake or real.</p><p><strong>VPN Service - NordVPN</strong></p><p>The Virtual private Network services hide your IP, mask your identity and since you will be changing your server, they spoof location on snapchat too. NordVPN is one of the most hailed VPNs and this is how you use it -</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download NordVPN either from Google or App store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-google-play-store-pic16.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn google play store"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: You need to sign up and the app quickly connects you to a nearby server. This is the Quick connect option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/nordvpn-us-quick-connect-pic17.jpg"                      alt="signup for quick connect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: However, you can change your location too. Go to the ‘More options’ and then choose Servers. Under this, go for All Countries to view the choices you have. Choose one and that server will be activated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/_thumbs/new-server-change-pic18.jpg"                      alt="choose the server"                ></p><p>So, the location of this new server will reflect on your snapchat snapmap too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-3-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions"></a><strong>Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><p><strong>Q1. Can you get someone’s Location from Snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - Yes, people can easily know your location through Snapchat. The new Snapmap feature makes it all the more easy. The snapmap shows your bitmoji’s location anywhere in the world, as long as your phone’s GPS is ON and you have the snapchat app open. So, people can zoom in and know your exact coordinates and even your house-no and residential details.</p><p><strong>Q2. Is Snapchat Location ever wrong?</strong></p><p>A - Snapchat tries to provide the accurate location most of the time. It uses your geo-coordinates that it detects when you Switch ON the GPS on your phone. It tracks the location in which your snap is taken and if you are on snapmap and sharing your location, it can provide the exact details of the place you are in. However, there is no authentic report that says that Snapchat shows 100% accurate location or if it can go wrong sometimes.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you tell if someone is hiding their location from you on snapchat?</strong></p><p>A - They will disappear off of the world map. Literally! So, whenever someone is hiding their location from you, it means they’ve either activated the Ghost Mode or they turned off the Location services of their phone. As a result, you will not find their bitmoji on the snapmap even if they are actively using the app. But if they’ve employed a Location spoofer, it is hard to say if the location is real or not.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a><strong>Part 4: Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt how to fake location on snapchat map, understand that these methods have their own hierarchy of success. While the location spoofer stands at the top-spot, using a VPN is the next best thing. If you want to rely on in-built features, know that they aren’t always successful. Make the right choice and keep your location a secret for your own privacy.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-netflix-location-to-get-more-country-version-on-nokia-g22-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Netflix Location to Get More Country Version On Nokia G22 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Xiaomi Redmi K70 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-infinix-hot-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Infinix Hot 30 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/quickly-remove-google-frp-lock-on-vivo-s18e-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>Quickly Remove Google FRP Lock on Vivo S18e</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-use-face-id-to-pay-for-apps-on-iphone-7-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/"><u>How to Use Face ID to Pay for Apps on iPhone 7?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-fake-the-location-to-get-around-the-mlb-blackouts-on-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Fake the Location to Get Around the MLB Blackouts on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-apple-iphone-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Apple iPhone 12? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/possible-solutions-to-restore-deleted-videos-from-realme-c53-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>Possible solutions to restore deleted videos from Realme C53</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/discover-the-best-movies-on-youtube-no-pay-required-for-2024/"><u>Discover the Best Movies on YouTube - No Pay Required for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-breaking-into-the-top-of-tiktok-a-blueprint-for-higher-likes-and-views/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Breaking Into the Top of TikTok  A Blueprint for Higher Likes and Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-twitch-broadcast-excellence-the-ultimate-5-guide/"><u>In 2024, Twitch Broadcast Excellence  The Ultimate 5 Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-for-overcoming-iphone-camera-focusing-glitches/"><u>In 2024, Tips for Overcoming iPhone Camera Focusing Glitches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-fcpx-cinematography-how-to-create-visually-stunning-videos/"><u>In 2024, FCPX Cinematography How to Create Visually Stunning Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-social-media-savvy-crafting-your-best-self-with-top-tips-for-bios-for-2024/"><u>[New] Social Media Savvy  Crafting Your Best Self with Top Tips for Bios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/save-money-on-titles-exclusive-list-of-11-free-creators-for-2024/"><u>Save Money on Titles - Exclusive List of 11 Free Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-turning-tape-backwards-instagrams-video-trickery/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Turning Tape Backwards  Instagram's Video Trickery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-change-your-voice-on-audacity/"><u>New 2024 Approved How to Change Your Voice on Audacity?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use.

If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly.

So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme C67 4G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done.

With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.</p><p>In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features.

There is no problem with that. Messenger allows users to search for a specific place, trace it on the map, and share the details. The receiver can view it in map form and get directions if necessary. See? It’s very easy and convenient. No need to type in long addresses just to share a particular location with your friend. You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.</p><p>Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users. One of which is the accuracy of the shared location information. Since the details are automatically generated through GPS, you can be sure that it is correct and definite. If you go out and track it down the neighborhood, you can certainly find the location in no time. Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Poco-C50"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Poco-C50" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Poco C50"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Poco C50</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Poco C50 to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done.

It offers a huge library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and more. However, the content you want to watch on Netflix depends on the country where you live.</p><p>The traditional method of circumventing region-locked content on Netflix is simply utilizing a VPN. You can also change Netflix country restrictions without it, but it will require a bit of work. If you’re interested to know how to change the Netflix region without a VPN, follow our quick article below to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/change-region-without-vpn-netflix.jpg"                      alt="change region without vpn netflix"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions"><a href="#Part-1-Netflix-and-Geo-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions"></a>Part 1: Netflix and Geo-Restrictions</h2><p>Netflix offers subscribers a wide range of content, but their library varies per region due to licensing and copyright agreements. The service price sometimes costs less in other countries, which is why using VPNs to save money on subscriptions are highly popular.</p><p>Using VPNs and other methods to change your region is not illegal, but it violates Netflix’s Terms of Use. If you’re caught using VPNs or other means to bypass their geo-restrictions, Netflix can suspend or terminate your account. This is why you should always take caution when navigating the streaming giant’s Terms of Use.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-2-Will-Netflix-Ban-My-Account-If-I-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?"></a>Part 2: Will Netflix Ban My Account If I Use a VPN?</h2><p>If you’re wondering if Netflix bans accounts that use VPN, the answer is “No, they don’t”. On the other hand, Netflix will block access to content if it detects that you’re connected to VPN. If this happens, simply turn off your VPN or try connecting to different servers on your VPN and retry.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN"><a href="#Part-3-Can-You-Change-Your-Netflix-Region-Without-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?"></a>Part 3: Can You Change Your Netflix Region Without a VPN?</h2><p>There are multiple ways to change your location on Netflix without a VPN, whether you’re on your computer, iPhone, or Android.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-11-5G"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-11-5G" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme 11 5G"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme 11 5G</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme 11 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done.

The app gives a route to the other person’s current location by tapping any member pointer. If someone is in danger or got an emergency, they can tap the panic button to send a mass text to the circle with their location. The app does not notify when circle members check someone’s location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-life360-notify-when-you-leave"><a href="#Part-2-Does-life360-notify-when-you-leave" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does life360 notify when you leave?"></a>Part 2: Does life360 notify when you leave?</h2><p>As the best family locator app, life360 notifies circle members about any user’s security or app-related activities. In addition, the app notifies all circle members when someone leaves or is removed from the circle. Does life360 notify when you log in to a new device? Yes, it does. The user can log into multiple devices but only once at a time. As soon as the user changes devices, everyone gets a notification with the new device’s location.</p><p>There are multiple life160 notifications for different scenarios. Everyone gets a “user removed” notification when a user leaves a circle. As long as the location sharing is on, circle members will get a notification when someone turns their location off. Suppose someone’s phone is dead, or there is a poor connection. In that case, life360 puts an exclamation mark next to that user’s name to notify other circle members.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-turn-off-location-on-life360-without-anyone-knowing"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-turn-off-location-on-life360-without-anyone-knowing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to turn off location on life360 without anyone knowing?"></a>Part 3: How to turn off location on life360 without anyone knowing?</h2><p>Although life360 provides excellent family location services, it also affects your privacy by tracking your location and texts as long as the phone and location services are on. It is the same for other family tracking apps. For example, suppose users want to attend to some private matters or want others to respect their privacy. The best way is to turn off their location on life360 so no one can track them, but it is not an option because you can’t do that on life360. Using a third-party location-changer app is the best solution in this case.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a location-changer application that allows users to change their device’s location with one click.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-Narzo-N53"><a href="#How-to-Change-Spotify-Location-After-Moving-to-Another-Country-On-Realme-Narzo-N53" class="headerlink" title="How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme Narzo N53"></a>How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Realme Narzo N53</h2><p>Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg"                      alt="spotify music app"                ></p><p>But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-for-changing-Location-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify"></a><strong>Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify</strong></h2><p>But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.</p><p><strong>Region specific Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg"                      alt="spotify region specific content"                ></p><p>Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.</p><p><strong>Spotify Unavailable</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg"                      alt="spotify unavailable"                ></p><p>Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Edit-Your-Country-on-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?</strong></h2><p>You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg"                      alt="premium-account-change-plan"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Apps-to-Fake-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme Narzo N53 to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change.

But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too.

You just have to find it precisely on the map and send the information afterward.</p><p>Convenience is just one thing. Messenger’s location-sharing feature has a lot more to offer to users.

You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.</p><p><strong>Playlists and Recommendations</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg"                      alt="spotify region geography playlists"                ></p><p>Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.</p><p>So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.</p><p><strong>Payment Plans</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg"                      alt="potify payment plan"                ></p><p>The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use.

If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg"                      alt="spotify log in page"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg"                      alt="spotify acct overview"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg"                      alt="new location on spotify"                ></p><p>If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Premium):</strong> In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly.

So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>Spoofer.

Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="dr.fone home screen"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="dr.fone virtual location"                ></p><p>The New Location will now display on your iPhone&#x2F;Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-VPN-to-change-Spotify-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?</strong></h2><p>A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.</p><p>Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg"                      alt="nordvpn app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg"                      alt="connect to server"                ></p><p>The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg"                      alt="change server using spotify"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg"                      alt="choose countries to change"                ></p><p>The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.</p><h2 id="Does-Airplane-Mode-Turn-off-GPS-Location-On-Realme-12-Pro-5G"><a href="#Does-Airplane-Mode-Turn-off-GPS-Location-On-Realme-12-Pro-5G" class="headerlink" title="Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Realme 12 Pro+ 5G?"></a>Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Realme 12 Pro+ 5G?</h2><p>Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G devices.

This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during <strong>airplane mode, Life360</strong> will not update your site.</p><h2 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h2><p>So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi.
