### 3.2 Fake location on WhatsApp using iTools location spoofer

Unfortunately, faking your WhatsApp location on iPhone is not as easy as you think. You can't just download an app that will help you to fake WhatsApp live location. Instead, you will have to use a computer program for this. There is a special tool designed by ThinkSky called iTools. It will allow the users to pick any location and trick your Infinix GT 10 Pro apps into believing that you are actually at that location.

Users don't even have to jailbreak their devices to do this. The steps you need to follow to send fake location WhatsApp are given below:

Step 1: Install the iTools software on your computer and connect your Infinix GT 10 Pro to the computer. Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.

Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the "Move Here" option on the screen, and your Infinix GT 10 Pro location will instantly move to that particular location.

Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option. The app will show the new fake location, and you can share it with anyone you want.

To get your real location back, you will have to reboot your Infinix GT 10 Pro. But you can only do this only 3 times for free. Also, this trick works on any iPhone running on iOS 12 and older.
