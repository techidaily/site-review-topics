- **Android version: FGL pro**

For Android people, many fake GPS apps can help them. Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.

**Step 1:** As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Honor 70 Lite 5G.

**Step 2:** Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” > “Security” > “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.

**Step 3:** Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” > “Apps” > “menu” > “Show System” > “Google Play Services” > “Uninstall Updates”.

![fgl steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” > “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.

![tap install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, go to “Settings” > “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” > “Google Play Store” and disable it.

**Step 6:** Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” > “FGL Pro”.

**Step 7:** Open the app now and set the desired location. Tap on the “Play” button, and you’re good to go.

### Method 2: Using VPN

The second effective method to Snapchat fake location is through the help of a VPN. There are a lot of options when it comes to VPN. However, you can choose Surshark if you can’t decide whether it is one of the best VPN that comes with build-in fake GPS tech. It is the cheapest and the VPN that provides you with the perfect way to enhance your Snapchat experience.

### Method 3: Using Xcode

The third method of fake GPS for Snapchat includes Xcode. Through Xcode, you could easily change the Snapchat location. Steps to a fake location with Xcode includes:

**Step 1:** In the first step, you must install Xcode from the Macs app store.

![xcode for snapchat location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg)

**Step 2:** Launch it and set up a project. Choose “Single View Application” and click “Next”.

![xcode steps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-14.jpg)

**Step 3:** Provide a name to the project and hit “Next”.

**Step 4:** Now, you must set up GIT on Xcode. You will notice a screen showing “Please tell me where you are” and the commands.

You are required to enter the commands in “Terminal”. Open it and type the following:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Please note:** “<you@example.com>” and “your name” should be changed with your info.

![enter the commands](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-16.jpg)

**Step 5:** Connect your Honor 70 Lite 5G to Mac and wait as Xcode will begin to process some files.

**Step 6:** You can now click on “Debug” menu and choose “Simulate Location”. Choose the desired location now and fake GPS.

## Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?

There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location. Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.

Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Honor 70 Lite 5G device and recheck it.

## Conclusion

Many different tools could help you to spoof Snapchat. But you must always prefer to choose the right one that could perfectly meet your needs. And it could provide you with the best experience of using Snapchat without any difficulty.
