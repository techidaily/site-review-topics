## How to Change/Fake Your Infinix Smart 8 Plus Location on Viber

Viber is one of the most commonly used messenger apps. It allows you to send short messages like texts, videos, images, audio, and documents. Viber also has another exciting feature that will enable you to share your location. But sometimes, you might want to **change location on Viber** to prank your friends or for security purposes. So, read on to learn how to **fake location on Viber** with some simple solutions.

## Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?

If you’ve used WhatsApp’s location feature before, you’ll know what Viber’s “My Location” is all about. With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.

But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Infinix Smart 8 Plus/Android browser. Therefore, you can send a location on Viber without knowing. This can be advantageous to stalkers or even cause misunderstanding in your relationship. What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send. But fret not because this post will help you **disable or enable My Location on Viber** according to your needs.

## Part 2: How to disable or enable My Location on Viber?

So, without wasting too much time, let’s find out the steps to disable/enable Viber location-sharing feature. It’s straightforward.

Step 1. Fire up your Viber app on mobile or PC and tap the **Chats** button. Here, proceed to open a chat that you want to enable/disable location sharing.

## Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?

So, is it possible to **Viber's fake location**? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.

But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). With this professional GPS tool, you teleport your Viber location to anywhere in the world with a simple mouse click.

## How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Infinix Smart 8 Plus

Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger? Here's the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don't even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.

## Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger

There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:

- **Business awareness**

Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.

- **Prank friends and have fun**

There's nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you're in a unique spot when you're just around them.

- **Hide identity**

Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.

- **Make new friends**

Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the "Nearby Friends" feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.

## Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger

After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let's now know how to do that with easy steps. You don't need third-party help to **mock live locations on Messenger on Android** or iPhone. That's because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:

Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.

Step 2. Click the "four dots" at the bottom-left corner and tap **Location**.

![facebook messenger location sharing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg)

Step 3. Now tap **Allow Location** and choose a new location on the world map that appears.

Step 4. After choosing a location, tap **Send Location** to share it with your selected friend. It's that easy!

## Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger \[iOS & Android\]

As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can't natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to **fake live location on Messenger on iOS** and Android, using a robust option like [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a good idea.

With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like [Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), [Instagram](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html), [Facebook](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html), etc., etc.

Here's how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:

**Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.**

![home page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the "Transfer Files" option.

**Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

On Dr.Fone's home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click **Get Started**. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings > Developer options >USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.

**Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.**

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once USB debugging is enabled, press **Next** to launch the map. Now enter your new location's address or GPS coordinates and tap **Move Here**. And there is that!

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

_**Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable**_

Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the "location" icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.

Up to this point, you shouldn't have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there's no proof that you're actually in that particular location.

So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.

## Part 5. FAQ: What People Also Ask about Facebook Location Services

### 1\. Why is my Facebook Messenger location wrong?

The issue of the wrong Facebook location is commonplace these days. Fortunately, it's nothing complicated as it's mainly about the incorrect GPS settings on your phone. So, go ahead and enable GPS tracking on your device.

Open Settings > Privacy > Location Services for iPhone users and then enable Location Services. On the other hand, Android users should click Settings > Security and Location > Locations > and enable Use Locations.

### 2\. Can I fake my location on Facebook?

In a typical scenario, it's impossible to lie about your location on Facebook. That's because the app asks for permission to track your GPS location before you can use it. But as you've seen, Wondershare Dr.Fone makes it a cakewalk to a fake live location on Messenger.

### 3\. How can I hide my location on Facebook?

As said earlier, the reason why Facebook gives the wrong location is because of disabled location settings. It's the reverse! So, use this Settings feature to hide your actual location on Facebook.

### Conclusion

Any queries regarding how to send a fake location on Messenger? Let us know if you have any. Meanwhile, use Messenger's inbuilt location feature to share an artificial place with a friend or contact. But because this method only allows you to share fake locations with a single chat, use Wondershare [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) instead. It's simple, fast, and effective. Are you ready?

Life360 is not just an app; it’s a digital lifeline connecting people with their loved ones. It’s primarily designed for family and close friends. By offering real-time location sharing, it ensures that members of your “Circle” (a group within the app) know where you are at any given moment. This feature is handy for parents monitoring their children’s whereabouts or friends coordinating meet-ups.

### The Purpose of Life360

At its core, Life360 is about safety and connectivity. The app includes features like location history, driving reports, and even crash detection, making it a versatile tool for modern families. It provides several benefits, like:

- **Safety assurance**. Knowing the whereabouts of your loved ones, especially in emergencies, can be invaluable.
- **Convenience**. Planning gatherings or ensuring a family member has arrived safely at a destination becomes more manageable.
- **Emergency response**. The app can alert users to potential emergencies involving Circle members.

### Reasons of Pausing Life360

However, there are instances where learning **how to pause Life360** becomes necessary:

- **Battery health**. Constant GPS tracking can drain your phone’s battery significantly. Temporarily pausing the app can help conserve battery life.
- **Privacy**. Sometimes, you might want some privacy about your location. Thus, some people would like to pause their Life360 location sharing.

### Methods To Pause Life360 From the App

Now, the question is, **can you pause your location on Life360?** Pausing Life360 can be done for a specific circle or the entire app. This section will show you some general steps to pause your location for the app. You can do it only for a specific circle or the whole app. Here’s how you can do those.

#### Pausing Location for a Specific Circle

Open Life360 and go to the main screen. Select the Circle you want to pause. Then, tap on Settings (usually represented by a gear icon) in the upper-right corner. Look for an option like **Location Sharing** and toggle it off. This action pauses your location sharing only for the selected Circle.

![location sharing life360 menu](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-02.jpg)

#### Pausing the Whole App

Regarding this method, pausing the location sharing for all your circles usually involves going through your phone’s **S ettings** and disabling location services for Life360. If you don’t want to do that, you can turn off location sharing for all your circles through the steps provided above.

By understanding and utilizing these features wisely, you can maintain your connection with your loved ones while managing your digital boundaries and battery health effectively. Remember, the aim is to balance connectivity with personal needs.

## Part 2: How To Pause Life360 From Settings

Life360 offers flexibility within its app and through your device’s settings. Understanding how to use these options can provide additional control over location sharing. Explore the various ways **how to pause Life360** outside the app itself.

### Pause Life360 From Android Settings

First, navigate to your Infinix Smart 8 Plus’s **Settings**. Then, look for the section listing all installed apps. This is usually named as “Apps.” Locate Life360 on the list of apps and open it. You should be able to see a **Force Stop** button at the bottom of the screen.

The great thing is that Life360 will only show your last known location to your circles. It will not say that “location services are off,” unlike the first two methods.

![airplane mode ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/how-to-pause-life360-04.jpg)

Each method serves a different purpose and offers varying levels of discretion.
