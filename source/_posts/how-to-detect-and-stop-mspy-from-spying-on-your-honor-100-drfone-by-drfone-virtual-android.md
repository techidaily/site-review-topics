## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Honor 100

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Honor 100?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Honor 100 **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Honor 100s.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Honor 100.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Honor 100, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Honor 100's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Honor 100 device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Honor 100 is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Honor 100 is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

## Part 2: How to Stop Somebody Spying Using mSpy on the phone?

When you figure out that somebody is spying on your device, the first thing that comes to your mind is how to stop it. If someone has installed mSpy on your device, you can easily control the process. This section will mention the complete process of stopping mSpy on your device. Like the spying app detection process, the spying app removal process is also different in the case of iPhone and Android devices. Below we have mentioned the complete processes of removing mSpy from your Honor 100 and iPhone device. There are two ways that you can use to remove this app from your devices

### Method 1: Prevent mSpy from Spying via Phone Settings App

The IP address and browsing history on the TikTok, time zone setting and mobile carrier are also collected by the TikTok as "Technical Information." In case you want to know if TikTok ensures your safety as well? The answer is no. If you give your location access to TikTok, it increases the chances of getting hacked.

#### Method 2: Changing Language on TikTok to Access Content from Other Regions

TikTok only shows the content of languages that are native to your region. Fortunately, you are allowed to change the language on TikTok and access the content of that region. However, this method only shows the content of the selected area.

Therefore, you can't add the language of any such region which has banned the application. Instead, follow the given steps to change your language on TikTok and access the content peacefully:

**Step 1:** Open the TikTok application and select "Profile," written on the lower right-hand corner of the interface.

![tap on profile option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/change-location-on-tiktok-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, click on the three dots mentioned in the right-hand corner and access the “Settings and Privacy” of your TikTok account. Now, choose the “Content Preferences” option written under the “Content & Activity” section.

![access content preferences](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/change-location-on-tiktok-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, add the language that is native to your target region. Now, you will be able to access the content of the particular region.

#### Method 3: Changing your SIM Card to Change Location on Tiktok

TikTok uses the region code of your SIM card to display the content of your region on the feed. Therefore, it will be helpful if you buy a SIM card from another area and use it on Your Honor 100 to watch that region's content quickly. This process is as simple as choosing a fake location and buying a SIM card from that region.

You can do so by ordering an international SIM card through Amazon and putting your SIM in the mobile phone. Now, delete the cache and app data. Then, open TikTok and enjoy various content. Unfortunately, you will have to buy a phone with a dual SIM. Moreover, some SIM cards might not work in your region unless you buy a mobile plan.

### 2\. For Computer

Now, let's discuss how to change your location on TikTok from your Computer. For this, we have introduced a VPN service that fakes the location on TikTok and helps you access content from different regions.

#### [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/)

ExpressVPN is a top-notch VPN that provides blazing-fast speed for browsing, streaming, and playing games with unlimited bandwidth. You can connect to the service anywhere as the application's high-speed servers work across 94 countries. In addition, it protects user data by offering the best security and encryption.

With the given following steps, you can set up ExpressVPN on your computer and access unlimited TikTok content:

**Step 1:** Launch the ExpressVPN software and tap on the “On” button to utilize the service. Now, press the “Smart Location” option.

**Step 2:** Select the VPN server location from the “All Location” tab or “Recommended” tab.

**Step 3:** Once you are connected, you will be able to use TikTok and watch content from the selected region with enhanced privacy and security.

## Part 4: FAQs about TikTok Location

### **1\. Is it not legal to change the TikTok location?**

It is legal to do so unless you are not misusing the application and watching objectional content from the region.

### **2\. How to turn off the GPS on TikTok?**

For Android devices, open the "Settings: and reach the "Location" tab. Now, press on the "App Permission" option and search for TikTok. Now, click on "Don't Allow."

For the iOS device, open the "Settings" app and click on "Privacy." Further, click on "Location Services" and find TikTok. Change the TikTok location setting to "Never."

### **3\. Is it safe to use TikTok with a VPN?**

Yes, TikTok will not be able to detect that you are using a VPN. Therefore, you will not be banned from using the application. It is safe to access TikTok with a VPN because it hides your IP address and location.
