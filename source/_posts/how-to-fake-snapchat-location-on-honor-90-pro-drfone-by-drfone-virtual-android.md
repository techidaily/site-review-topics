### How to turn it off?

Well, to be honest, a lot of people don't like to share their location with others on Snapchat. Thankfully, you can just disable it by visiting your Snapchat Settings and turning on the Ghost Mode.

There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location.
