Talking about Snapchat, this app offers you different badges and filters depending upon your Geographical location. It actually utilizes the GPS feature of your device to determine where you are located. This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location.

## Part 1. What Snapchat is using your location for?

If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”. If you wish to enable this feature, you literally need to authorize Snapchat “3x times” and the last, fourth one to authorize your device.

With the SnapMap feature enabled, you can easily get to know about the whereabouts of your friends, and in turn, there’re allowed to know yours. As long as the Snapchat app is running over your screen, the SnapMap location of your Bitmoji gets updated dynamically. But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.

Step 3. Now write whatever is on your mind and add the location to your latest post. It's that easy!

## Method 4: Fake Location for Facebook's Nearby Friends via a Tool

While signing up on Facebook, you'll be requested to allow the platform access to your actual GPS location. This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you're willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you'll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.

Install and run Dr.Fone on your Mac or Windows PC and then connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable. After that, select the file transfer option on your phone and then tap **Virtual Location** on Dr.Fone.

**Step 2. Connect your phone to the software.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

You'll see a new Dr.Fone window, where you'll click the **Get Started** button. Then, enable USB debugging on your phone before clicking **Next.**

**Step 3. Choose a location and start moving.**

The Virtual Location map will launch after successfully connecting your smartphone to Dr.Fone. Now enter and select a location you wish to move to and click **Move Here**. Alternatively,  you can tap an area to move to on the map and choose whether to move by foot, bicycle, scooter, or car. Your iPhone and Android device will save your new location automatically.

## Wrap it up

See, you don't need an expensive VPN service to fake your GPS location on Facebook convincingly. With Dr.Fone, you can easily change your ZTE Blade A73 5G or iPhone location, which will immediately reflect on apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Telegram, and so on. And guess what? There are a host of other phone management features to exploit. You should try it!
