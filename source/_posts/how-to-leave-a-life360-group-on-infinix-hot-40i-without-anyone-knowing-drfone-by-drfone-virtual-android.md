## Part 2. How To Leave a Life360 Circle Without Anyone Knowing

Leaving a Life360 Circle through the standard method may not align with your preference in certain scenarios. In such cases, there are many methods you can use to maintain your privacy without alerting fellow Circle members. Here are some strategic approaches:

### Method 1: Using an App To Spoof Your Location

One of the most effective and safe ways to trick Life360 without triggering notifications is by using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Virtual Location.

![dr.fone main window](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

#### How To Spoof Your Life360 Circle Location Using Dr.Fone

Follow the steps below to learn **how to leave a Life360 Circle without anyone knowing** using Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location tool:



- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone, then connect your Infinix Hot 40i via USB cable. Launch the tool from **Toolbox** > **Virtual** **Location**. Click **Get Started** to proceed.

![dr.fone connecting smartphone to computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2:** Activate **Developer Mode** on your smartphone by following on-screen instructions in **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**. Restart the Infinix Hot 40i device, unlock it, and select **Turn On**. Enter your password.

![dr.fone developer mode instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-3.png)

- **Step 3:** On the map, enter the number of movements and select **Round** or **Loop** trip. Adjust the speed, then click **Move Here** to start the simulation. **Pause** or clear to revert.

The next method can serve as a last resort if using Dr.Fone is impossible. Be aware that they come with the trade-off of notifying other Circle members. Maintaining open communication within the Circle is crucial. Do these alternatives only when it’s necessary for your privacy.

### Method 2: Turning Off Mobile Data and Wi-Fi

If Dr.Fone is unavailable, a simple tactic is to disable both mobile data and Wi-Fi.

- **Step 1:** Open your device settings. Go to **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.
- **Step 2:** Disable both **mobile data** and **Wi-Fi**. Life360 will lose real-time tracking capability, but be cautious, as this may raise suspicion.

### Method 3: Switching To Airplane Mode

Another option is to activate Airplane Mode, severing all connections, including location sharing. Again, this method may alert Circle members to your departure.

- **Step 1:** Access your device settings. Look for **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.

![airplane mode interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-11.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Toggle on **Airplane Mode**. The method severs all connections, including location sharing.

### Method 4: Turning Off Your Infinix Hot 40i

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Enable **Battery saving** or **Power saving** mode.

### Method 7: Getting a Burner Phone

Acquiring a secondary, inexpensive phone for Life360 use may be an alternative if all else fails. This method involves monetary considerations and may not be practical for everyone.

### What if People in the Circle Feel Micromanaged?

Knowing the feeling of being micromanaged, especially among kids and teens, Life360 introduces the Bubble feature. The Bubble feature allows users to set a custom safety zone. It balances monitoring and granting a sense of autonomy within a designated area.

## How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Infinix Hot 40i

In this era of smartphones and smart gadgets, our lives have been stored inside these devices. Privacy gets more important and urgent when so many apps can spy on you easily. Being concerned about your privacy is a very important thing to consider. We care about your privacy, and we have the tools to take proper measures for the mSpy parental control app.

There are many apps like mSpy that normal users can't detect due to their stealth behavior. If you want to know how to detect and stop mSpy from spying on you, then you are in the right place. This article will show you how to detect and remove mSpy on Android and iPhone devices without being tech-savvy. Read all the guidelines below on removing mSpy from Android and iPhone without hassle.

## Part 1: What is mSpy, and is mSpy detectable on Your Infinix Hot 40i?

In this increasingly cynical world, people are using all sorts of monitoring software to monitor the phone activities of kids and employees. One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else's mobile phone or device.

Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees' devices or kids' phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are **mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker**, etc.

The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don't worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.

### How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices

For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that'll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings. Follow these steps:

![android settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/android-settings.jpg)

- Step 1: Go to your Infinix Hot 40i **phone settings**.
- Step 2: Select **Security**.
- Step 3: Go to **Device Administrators** or **Device Admin apps**.
- Step 4: Navigate to **Update Service** (the name mSpy uses to run undetected). See if this service is enabled or disabled. If it is, you have spying software installed on your Infinix Hot 40is.

### How to Detect mSpy on iPhone Devices

Apple users don't have a way to tell for sure if mSpy is installed compared to Android users. But, there are some ways to tell if their devices are monitored.

#### 1\. Download history on the App Store

Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called **System Update**. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users' devices to the operators' servers. It's important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Infinix Hot 40i.

#### 2\. Unusually High Data Usage

There is a big sign that spyware is running in the background. To check the mobile data on your Infinix Hot 40i, you need to go to **Settings** and click on **Mobile Data**. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user's average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.

#### 3\. Have Access to Your Device's Microphone or Camera

When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Infinix Hot 40i's camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.

#### 4\. Increased Device Shut Down Time

If the Infinix Hot 40i device fails to turn off properly or takes an unusually long time to do so, it can point to the presence of spyware, or if the phone reboot without your command, then maybe someone is controlling your phone.

#### 5\. Jailbreak your own iPhone and download apps from untrusted sources

If you detect the presence of an app named Cydia, then consider it an alarm bell. This advanced package tool will further install apps from untrusted sources. To find out if your Infinix Hot 40i is jailbroken or not:

- Step 1: Drag your finger downward from the center of the iOS home screen.
- Step 2: Type "Cydia" in the Search field.
- Step 3: If you find Cydia, then your Infinix Hot 40i is jailbroken.

Some signs can come in handy when you want to ensure if someone is spying on you or not

To connect your phone to this all-in-one software, first, enable "transfer files" instead of "charging" on your phone. Then, enable USB debugging under the settings tab. On Android, just click Settings >Additional Settings > Developer options > USB debugging.

**Step 3. Choose a new WhatsApp live location to share.**

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

After USB debugging is on, tap **Next** and enter the new location on the search field at the top-left corner. Now choose the area and tap **Move Here**. And there is that! Interestingly, you can choose a movement route and customize the speed.

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

In 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you're safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.

Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can't be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.

So without wasting time, here's how to send live Location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the Location.

Step 3. Now click the **Attach** button on the text field and click **Location**.

![whatsapp location not updating click location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-4.jpg)

Step 3. From there, allow WhatsApp access to your device's location and then press the **Share Live Location** button.

![whatsapp location not updating](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-5.jpg)

Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your Location, add a comment, and tap the **Send** button. That's it!

**Note:** As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device's location and then share it on WhatsApp.
