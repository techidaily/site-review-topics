Leaving a Life360 Circle through the standard method may not align with your preference in certain scenarios. In such cases, there are many methods you can use to maintain your privacy without alerting fellow Circle members. Here are some strategic approaches:

### Method 1: Using an App To Spoof Your Location

One of the most effective and safe ways to trick Life360 without triggering notifications is by using [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) - Virtual Location.

![dr.fone main window](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

#### How To Spoof Your Life360 Circle Location Using Dr.Fone

Follow the steps below to learn **how to leave a Life360 Circle without anyone knowing** using Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location tool:



- **Step 1:** Download and install Dr.Fone, then connect your Tecno Spark 10 4G via USB cable. Launch the tool from **Toolbox** > **Virtual** **Location**. Click **Get Started** to proceed.

![dr.fone connecting smartphone to computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

- **Step 2:** Activate **Developer Mode** on your smartphone by following on-screen instructions in **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Developer Mode**. Restart the Tecno Spark 10 4G device, unlock it, and select **Turn On**. Enter your password.

![dr.fone developer mode instructions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-3.png)

- **Step 3:** On the map, enter the number of movements and select **Round** or **Loop** trip. Adjust the speed, then click **Move Here** to start the simulation. **Pause** or clear to revert.

![dr.fone simulate movement with map](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The next method can serve as a last resort if using Dr.Fone is impossible. Be aware that they come with the trade-off of notifying other Circle members. Maintaining open communication within the Circle is crucial. Do these alternatives only when it’s necessary for your privacy.

### Method 2: Turning Off Mobile Data and Wi-Fi

If Dr.Fone is unavailable, a simple tactic is to disable both mobile data and Wi-Fi.

- **Step 1:** Open your device settings. Go to **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.
- **Step 2:** Disable both **mobile data** and **Wi-Fi**. Life360 will lose real-time tracking capability, but be cautious, as this may raise suspicion.

- **Step 1:** Access your device settings. Look for **Connections** or **Network & Internet**.

![airplane mode interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-11.jpg)

### Method 4: Turning Off Your Tecno Spark 10 4G

A straightforward yet noticeable method involves turning off your device. While it suspends location tracking on Life360, frequent use may draw attention.

### Method 5: Disabling Background App Refresh

In your device settings, disable **Background App Refresh** for Life360. Although this may impact location accuracy, it’s an option to consider if Dr.Fone isn’t accessible.

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Locate Life360 and disable **Background App Refresh** for the app. Alternatively, you can disable **Background App Refresh** as a whole.

### Method 6: Enabling Battery Saving Mode

Switching to “Battery saving” or “Power saving” mode can affect the frequency of Life360 updates. While it offers a subtle way to limit location sharing, it may not provide foolproof privacy. Follow the steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

![enable battery saving mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-13.jpg)
