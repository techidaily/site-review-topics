- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for **Apps** or **Application Manager**.

![disable life360 background app refresh](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/leave-life360-group-12.jpg)

- **Step 1:** Go to your device **Settings**. Look for the **Battery** option.

## Part II. 7 Other Methods To Hide Location on Life360

Here are alternative solutions to hide your location on Life360 without resorting to third-party apps. These methods might not provide a foolproof solution, and their effectiveness can vary.

### Turn On Airplane Mode

Enabling Airplane Mode on your smartphone disables all wireless communication, including GPS. While effective, the method will also interrupt calls and messages. Airplane mode is suitable for times when you need complete privacy.

### Turn Off WiFi and Data

Disabling WiFi and mobile data prevents your phone from sending location updates to Life360. Note that the method may raise suspicion if others notice your lack of connectivity.

### Turn Off Location Services or Precise Mode

You can turn off Location Services or switch to a less precise location mode in your phone settings. Keep in mind that this may affect other apps relying on location information, and it’s not a foolproof solution.

![iphone location services and precise mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/hide-location-on-life360-12.jpg)

### Low Data Mode

Some devices offer a Low Data Mode. The feature reduces the amount of data your phone uses. While not designed for hiding your location, it may slow down or limit the transmission of location data.

### Disable Circle’s Location Sharing

Disabling location sharing within the circle settings can prevent your location from being visible to other members. Be cautious, as this action may prompt questions from circle members.

### Use a Burner Phone

Using a secondary or temporary phone for Life360 can provide a discreet way to manage your location. The method requires an additional device and may not be practical for everyone.

### Uninstall Life360 on Your Honor Magic 6 Lite

The most direct method to prevent Life360 from tracking your location is to uninstall the app temporarily. It ensures that no location data is transmitted. Remember that this action may be noticeable if your absence from the app is monitored.
