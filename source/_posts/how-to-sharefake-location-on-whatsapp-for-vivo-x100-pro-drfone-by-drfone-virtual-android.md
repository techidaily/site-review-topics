But fret not, we’re glad to bring you a detailed tutorial with which you can easily perform location spoofing on Snapchat and that too, without jailbreaking your Vivo X100 Pro.

Step 1: Install Xcode and Set up a Dummy app

    ![Setup GIT](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

2. For this, fire up the “Terminal”over your Mac and then execute the commands as follows:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Note:** Change the values for “<you@example.com>”and “your name” with your information.

![Change the values](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

6. Next, you need to make sure that to set up a development team and meanwhile, connect your Vivo X100 Pro to your Mac computer.

    ![connect iphone to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

    ![process some symbol files](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg)

Step 3: Move Bitmoji

Now, you’re all set to fake location for Snapchat map. For this, simply hit on the “Debug” menu and then opt for “Simulate Location” from the drop-down window. Lastly, select the location from the list as per your preference and you’re done.

## Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android

Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Vivo X100 Pro. Here’s all that you need to do.

1. Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the “fake GPS” app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Vivo X100 Pro to be rooted.
2. You need to opt for the “Fakegps free” app for Snapchat. This app doesn’t require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.
3. Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, you’ll be asked to“ENABLE MOCK LOCATIONS”. Hit on it and you’ll be redirected to the“Developer options” screen.
4. Here, you need to simply tap on the “Select Mock Location App” option and opt for “FakeGPS Free” from the list of options appearing.

    ![FakeGPS Free](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

**Note:** You may need to enable the “Developer options” first to access these settings. For this, head to the “Settings”>“About Phone”> hit on “Build Number” – x7 times.

6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
