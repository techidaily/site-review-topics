### 4.2. Change Snapchat Location using Xcode (complex)

Now, if we talk about fake location for Snapchat map on iPhone, it’s not as easy as it looks. You need to be an extremely tech-savvy person to **fake Snapchat location without jailbreaking** your Vivo Y200. You simply can’t download a Snapchat location spoofer app over your Vivo Y200 and fake it. But fret not, we’re glad to bring you a detailed tutorial with which you can easily perform location spoofing on Snapchat and that too, without jailbreaking your Vivo Y200.

Step 1: Install Xcode and Set up a Dummy app

1. Grab your Mac computer first and then head over to the App Store. Now, look for the Xcode application and get it installed on your computer.

    ![look for Xcode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-5.jpg)

2. Once the application is installed, launch it over. The Xcode window will come up over your screen. Now, set up a new project and select “single view application” followed by hitting “Next”.

    ![setup a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-6.jpg)

3. Then, give a name to your project, for instance, “GeoSpy” and hit on the “Next” button.

Step 2: Setup GIT on Xcode

1. On the upcoming screen, Xcode will throw up a pop-up message stating “Please tell me who you are” and some GIT commands that you need to execute.

    ![Setup GIT](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg)

2. For this, fire up the “Terminal”over your Mac and then execute the commands as follows:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Note:** Change the values for “<you@example.com>”and “your name” with your information.

![Change the values](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

6. Next, you need to make sure that to set up a development team and meanwhile, connect your Vivo Y200 to your Mac computer.

    ![connect iphone to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

7. Once done, opt it in as the build device and while you do it, ensure to keep it unlocked.
8. Lastly, if everything is performed correctly, Xcode will now process some symbol files, please be patient and wait for it to complete.

    ![process some symbol files](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg)

Step 3: Move Bitmoji

Now, you’re all set to fake location for Snapchat map. For this, simply hit on the “Debug” menu and then opt for “Simulate Location” from the drop-down window. Lastly, select the location from the list as per your preference and you’re done.

## Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android

Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Vivo Y200. Here’s all that you need to do.

1. Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the “fake GPS” app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Vivo Y200 to be rooted.
2. You need to opt for the “Fakegps free” app for Snapchat. This app doesn’t require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.
3. Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, you’ll be asked to“ENABLE MOCK LOCATIONS”. Hit on it and you’ll be redirected to the“Developer options” screen.
4. Here, you need to simply tap on the “Select Mock Location App” option and opt for “FakeGPS Free” from the list of options appearing.

    ![FakeGPS Free](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

**Note:** You may need to enable the “Developer options” first to access these settings. For this, head to the “Settings”>“About Phone”> hit on “Build Number” – x7 times.

6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
8. Lastly, hit the “play” button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.
