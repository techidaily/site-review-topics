- **Step 2** Select Device As Source and Destination

When it opens in a new window, the platform will detect the connected iOS and Android devices. As they are detected, the data is loaded onto the platform and displayed at the bottom of the iPhone SE (2022) device. However, it is important for you to define the path of transfer, thus, the selection of **Source** and **Destination.** Use the **Flip** button if needed to change the direction of the transfer.
