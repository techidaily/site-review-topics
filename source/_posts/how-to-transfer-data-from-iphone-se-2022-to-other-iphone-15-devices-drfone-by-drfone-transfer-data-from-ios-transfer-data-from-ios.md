### Part 1: Transfer Data From iOS To Android

- **Step 1** Launch Phone Transfer Tool

Initiate the process by launching Wondershare Dr.Fone on the computer. Continue from **Toolbox > Phone Transfer** to redirect towards opening the particular tool.

_The Dr.Fone Mac version still has the old interface, but it does not affect the use of the Dr.Fone function. We will update it as soon as possible._

- **Step 2** Select Device As Source and Destination

When it opens in a new window, the platform will detect the connected iOS and Android devices. As they are detected, the data is loaded onto the platform and displayed at the bottom of the iPhone SE (2022) device. However, it is important for you to define the path of transfer, thus, the selection of **Source** and **Destination.** Use the **Flip** button if needed to change the direction of the transfer.

After the selection of Source and Destination, continue to select the categories of data that you want to transfer. Checkmark all the required data types and proceed to tap the **Start Transfer** button. You can choose the **Clear data before copy** option to remove existing data from the destination device.
