## Unlock Locked iPhone 13 Pro Max by Restoring it to Default Settings – iTunes

iPhone users make sure that they connect and sync their devices with iTunes because their data is safe. iPhone users live without the fear of losing their data because it is backed up. Taking more advantage of this, iPhone users can restore their phone to default settings and can even unlock their iPhone without using a passcode.

Let us show you how to unlock iPhone 13 Pro Max without using a passcode;

1. Start the process by turning off your iPhone 13 Pro Max.
2. After that, plug in your phone to the computer and open iTunes.
3. Once the phone is connected with iTunes, click on 'Summary' that will appear on the screen's left side.

5. This option will bring you to a new window that will be asking for your confirmation on the decision to restore your device.
6. As soon as that is done and iTunes has finished the process, your iPhone 13 Pro Max will be restored to default settings.

## Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max Without A Computer

here are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max and return the device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled iPhone 13 Pro Max is using third-party tools such as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.



## Is It Possible to Unlock iPhone 13 Pro Max without a Passcode?

Unlocking an iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode is possible, but it's not as simple as entering a code. Besides, there are different methods that you can follow to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max

And we are going to teach all those methods with some simple steps. So, without any further ado, let's get started.

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the `Find My iPhone` function, then you can try it to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![Use Find My iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.
- **Step 2**: Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.
- **Step 3**: Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.
- **Step 4**: Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your iPhone 13 Pro Max from the list of devices.
- **Step 5**: Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.
- **Step 6**: Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max:

![Unlock it with iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/2.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 13 Pro Max to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.
- **Step 2**: Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.
- **Step 3**: Once recognized, your iPhone 13 Pro Max will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.
- **Step 4**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.
- **Step 5**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max:

![Use Recovery Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/3.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 13 Pro Max to the computer and launch the iTunes application.
- **Step 2**: Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.
- **Step 3**: As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.
- **Step 4**: On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.
- **Step 5**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.
- **Step 6**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use a Third-Party Tool

If you are unable to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max using the above methods, you can use a third-party tool like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/). This tool is designed to help you unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max without a passcode. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock to unlock your iPhone 13 Pro Max:

- **Step 1**: Start Dr.Fone on your computer. Then, launch the program and select `Screen Unlock`.

![screen unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/4.avif)

- **Step 2**: Create the connection from your iPhone 13 Pro Max to the computer with a lightning cable.

![create connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/5.avif)

- **Step 3**: Follow the image on the screen to make your device enter in `DFU mode` or `Recovery mode`.

- **Step 4**: Once your device gets into DFU mode or Recovery mode, Dr.Fone will ask you to choose the right firmware for your iPhone 13 Pro Max.

![choose firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/6.avif)

- **Step 5**: Upon selecting the right firmware, Dr.Fone will start downloading the firmware for your device. Once it's finished, click "Unlock Now" to remove the Passcode.

![unlock now](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/7.avif)

You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your iPhone 13 Pro Max.

Once the process is completed, your iPhone 13 Pro Max will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your iPhone 13 Pro Max passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.
