## Unlock Locked iPhone 15 Pro by Restoring it to Default Settings â€“ iTunes

iPhone users make sure that they connect and sync their devices with iTunes because their data is safe. iPhone users live without the fear of losing their data because it is backed up. Taking more advantage of this, iPhone users can restore their phone to default settings and can even unlock their iPhone without using a passcode.

Let us show you how to unlock iPhone 15 Pro without using a passcode;

1. Start the process by turning off your iPhone 15 Pro.
2. After that, plug in your phone to the computer and open iTunes.
3. Once the phone is connected with iTunes, click on 'Summary' that will appear on the screen's left side.

4. After the summary screen is opened, you will see the option of 'Restore iPhone'; click on that option.

5. This option will bring you to a new window that will be asking for your confirmation on the decision to restore your device.
6. As soon as that is done and iTunes has finished the process, your iPhone 15 Pro will be restored to default settings.

## Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/2.avif)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your iPhone 15 Pro would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Pro Using iTunes or macOS Finder

Of course, there is an official way that Apple provides for users to restore device firmware using iTunes or macOS Finder. For this, iPhone 15 Pro is put under Recovery Mode manually and Finder or iTunes is used to reinstall software on it directly from Apple. This process is fine for people who are conversant in tech, since this process can throw up a lot of errors that are just numbers, and people can get confused as to what they mean, resulting in frustration.

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 15 Pro to a Windows/ macOS device and launch iTunes. If you are on a Mac that runs macOS Catalina or higher, open Finder since you would not have access to iTunes anymore.

- **Step 2**: Pick your iPhone 15 Pro and do the following:
  - (2.1) Press the volume up button and let it go.
  - (2.2) Press the volume down button and let it go.
  - (2.3) Press the Side Button (power button, on the right side of your iPhone 15 Pro) and keep it pressed till Finder or iTunes detects the phone in Recovery Mode.

![Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Pro Using iTunes or macOS Finder](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-a-disabled-iphone/5.avif)

- **Step 3**: Choose Restore to download and reinstall the latest iOS on your iPhone 15 Pro and unlock your iPhone 15 Pro.

When the iPhone 15 Pro reboots, it will be reset to factory settings, and you can set it up again as you did when brand new.



## Is It Possible to Unlock iPhone 15 Pro without a Passcode?

Unlocking an iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode is possible, but it's not as simple as entering a code. Besides, there are different methods that you can follow to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro

And we are going to teach all those methods with some simple steps. So, without any further ado, let's get started.

### Use Find My iPhone

Once you have activated the `Find My iPhone` function, then you can try it to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode. This is an easy and effective method to complete this task. Here's how you can do it:

![Use Find My iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Go to icloud.com from any web browser on your computer or another iOS device.
- **Step 2**: Enter your Apple ID and password to log into your iCloud account.
- **Step 3**: Click on the 'Find My iPhone' option.
- **Step 4**: Select the 'All Devices' option at the top of the screen and select your iPhone 15 Pro from the list of devices.
- **Step 5**: Click the 'Erase' option to confirm your action.
- **Step 6**: Once your device has been erased, you can set it up again and use it without a passcode.

### Unlock it with iTunes

Another way to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode is by using iTunes. For this method to work, you must have synced your device with iTunes at least once. If you haven't done that, this method won't work. Here's how you can use iTunes to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro:

![Unlock it with iTunes](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/2.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 15 Pro to the computer you previously used to sync your device with iTunes.
- **Step 2**: Open the iTunes application on your computer and wait for it to recognize your device.
- **Step 3**: Once recognized, your iPhone 15 Pro will appear in the iTunes window. Click on the 'Summary' option present in the left sidebar.
- **Step 4**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the right sidebar.
- **Step 5**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use Recovery Mode

If you have never tried to sync your device with iTunes or used the Find My iPhone feature, you can use recovery mode to unlock your device. This more complex method will erase all the data on your device. So, ensure that you have backed up your data before proceeding with this method. Here's how you can use recovery mode to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro:

![Use Recovery Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/3.avif)

- **Step 1**: Connect your iPhone 15 Pro to the computer and launch the iTunes application.
- **Step 2**: Press and hold down the 'Volume' and 'Power' buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.
- **Step 3**: As soon as you see the Connect to iTunes screen, release the buttons.
- **Step 4**: On your computer, you will now see a message that iTunes detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Click on the 'OK' button.
- **Step 5**: Now, click on the 'Restore iPhone' button in the Summary tab.
- **Step 6**: Confirm your action and wait for the process to be completed. Once done, you can set up your device as new and use it without a passcode.

### Use a Third-Party Tool

If you are unable to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro using the above methods, you can use a third-party tool like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/). This tool is designed to help you unlock your iPhone 15 Pro without a passcode. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro:

- **Step 1**: Start Dr.Fone on your computer. Then, launch the program and select `Screen Unlock`.

![screen unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/4.avif)

- **Step 2**: Create the connection from your iPhone 15 Pro to the computer with a lightning cable.

![create connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/5.avif)

- **Step 3**: Follow the image on the screen to make your device enter in `DFU mode` or `Recovery mode`.

- **Step 4**: Once your device gets into DFU mode or Recovery mode, Dr.Fone will ask you to choose the right firmware for your iPhone 15 Pro.

![choose firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/6.avif)

- **Step 5**: Upon selecting the right firmware, Dr.Fone will start downloading the firmware for your device. Once it's finished, click "Unlock Now" to remove the Passcode.

![unlock now](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-passcode/7.avif)

You only need to wait for some time as the process may take several minutes. So be patient and don't interrupt the process; otherwise, it may permanently damage your iPhone 15 Pro.

Once the process is completed, your iPhone 15 Pro will be unlocked, and you can choose a new passcode.

This is the easiest and most effective way to reset your iPhone 15 Pro passcode. So, if you're looking for a hassle-free solution, this is the one you should choose.


## Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your iPhone 15 Pro again.

- **Tip 1: About Passcodes**

1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

- **Tip 2: Use Face ID**

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your iPhone 15 Pro, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the iPhone disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/cart.php?PRODS=4719741&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875"><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/EN-Dr.Fone%20970_90.png" border="0"></a>

![Start Unlock](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/8.avif)

After a while, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) will notify you of a successful bypass. You can now restart the device and use it. This option is restrictive in nature as you will be unable to use the iPhone to make calls or access cellular services including iCloud. This option is best for when you want to see/ recover some data from the device that you would otherwise lose.



## Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Pro Without A Computer

here are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled iPhone 15 Pro with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Pro or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Pro.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 Pro and return the device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if youâ€™re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled iPhone 15 Pro is using third-party tools such as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) â€“ Screen Unlock (iOS). However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 15 Pro with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.
