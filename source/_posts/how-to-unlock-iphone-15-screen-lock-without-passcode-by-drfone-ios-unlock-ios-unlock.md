## Prevent iPhone From Getting Disabled Again

After all this to get access back, you might think let's go passcode-less and prevent the hassle. Don't do that - that's worse and unsafe. Instead, here are tips you can use to make sure you don't accidentally disable your iPhone 15 again.

- **Tip 1: About Passcodes**

1.1 Set a passcode that is easier to remember for you but difficult to think of for thieves and others.
1.2 Never use birthdates, years, vehicle numbers or any such numbers that may be easily tried by others.
1.3 Never use repeating numbers.
1.4 Do not use your ATM PIN as your phone passcode either. Think of some digits or combination that makes sense to you and only you. And then use it.

- **Tip 2: Use Face ID**

Along with Passcode comes the option of Face ID on your iPhone 15, so use that. That will minimize instances for you to enter your passcode, and may make you forget it again, though. So, make sure that the passcode you set does make sense to you and you can remember it always without effort.

Not all of us have the memory of elephants. With Touch ID and Face ID on our iPhones minimizing the use of passcodes, we may forget them. Another factor in forgetting passcodes is being too smart for our own good and trying to set up such a secure passcode that even we are not able to remember it. If we enter incorrect passcode too many times, the iPhone disables itself and we need to restore it to factory settings to unlock it again. There are several ways to do that, depending on the time you are willing to spend on the job and your proficiency level, along with the resources that you have with you right now. For example, if a method requires use of another iOS device and you do not have it, that method is not useful to you right now, pick another. Lastly, when the device is reset, instead of going passcode-less to make sure that you do not forget the passcode again, it is best to set up a passcode that you can somehow remember.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Without A Computer

here are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled iPhone 15 with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 15.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled iPhone 15 and return the device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled iPhone 15 is using third-party tools such as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 15 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.

![Unlock Now](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-a-disabled-iphone/4.avif)

Your iPhone 15 will be unlocked in a short span of time. Please note that all data would have been wiped out from the device. When you set the device up again, if you set it to use iCloud, data such as Contacts, iCloud Photos, iCloud Drive data, etc. will be downloaded onto your device again. The apps you had on your iPhone 15 prior to it getting disabled can be downloaded again from the App Store. If you did not use iCloud but backed up the data manually, you will have to manually restore that data onto the device again.


## Unlock Disabled iPhone 15 Using Find My iPhone App

There are times you have another iOS device in the family or just lying around, you can use that device to unlock your disabled iPhone 15. This method is particularly useful if you're traveling with family or alone, and only have family members with their own iOS devices or, say, your iPad with you. As always, note that all these methods will wipe your data from your iPhone.

- **Step 1**: Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac.

![Open the Find My app on your other iOS device or Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-a-disabled-iphone/6.avif)

- **Step 2**: Select your disabled iPhone 15 from the devices from the left pane, click/ tap your disabled iPhone 15 and click/ tap Erase This Device

The disabled iPhone will be wiped and reset to factory settings. You can then set it up again.


## Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.
