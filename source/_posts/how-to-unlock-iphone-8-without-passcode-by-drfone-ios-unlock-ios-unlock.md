## Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (iPhone 8)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone 8 but forgot to erase the device before submitting and consequently, the device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that iPhone 8 to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

Disabling Activation Lock on iPhone 8 is easy if you have the Apple ID credentials that are associated with the iPhone 8.

![Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the device to factory settings.
- **Step 2**: When you set up the device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the device. Do that and you are golden!

### Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the device and removing the device from the associated iCloud account.

- **Step 1**: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at [https://icloud.com](https://secure.2checkout.com/order/cart.php?PRODS=4719741&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875).
- **Step 2**: Sign In and go to `Find iPhone`.

![Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/2.avif)

- **Step 3**: Click All Devices and select the device that was sold to the user.
- **Step 4**: Click Erase iPhone and if the device is still there after the erase is complete, click Remove From Account.

![Erase iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/3.avif)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the iPhone in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the iPhone and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/4.avif)

- **Step 1**: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- **Step 2**: Select Devices under Intune.
- **Step 3**: Select All Devices.
- **Step 4**: Locate the device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- **Step 5**: Under the Overview pane of the device, select Wipe.
- **Step 6**: When the device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

The device will be reset, and employees can set it up again with a new Apple ID.


## Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked

![Checking If Your Apple ID Is Locked](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/2.avif)

A locked Apple ID is rather unmistakable. Your iPhone 8 would keep telling you that your Apple ID is locked for your security. Your Apple ID could be locked or disabled altogether if someone has tried to gain access to your account (and, obviously, failed). Apple would disable access to the Apple ID unless you are able to prove rightful ownership and reset the password successfully.



## Unlock Disabled iPhone 8 Without A Computer

here are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled iPhone 8 with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 8 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 8.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled iPhone 8 and return the device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled iPhone 8 is using third-party tools such as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 8 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.



## How to use Face ID on iPhone 8 to pay with Apple Pay

- **Step1**: If Apple Pay is supported by banking institutions in your country, you can set it up by adding a supported bank‘s credit card, debit card, or prepaid card to the Wallet app on your iPhone 8.

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/4.avif)

- **Step2**: When a card is added and ready to use, check that Apple Pay is enabled under Settings > Face ID and Passcode.

- **Step3**: For App Store/ Book Store/ iTunes Store purchases, it works as always, you double-press the Side Button to authenticate and use your default card.

- **Step4**: Look at your iPhone 8 to authenticate yourself using your Face ID and make the purchase.

- **Step5**: When paying at retail outlets, hold your iPhone 8 (top being close to the reader) and wait for the checkmark and Done message.

- **Step6**: To pay using Apple Pay on websites, choose Apple Pay as the payment method, double press the Side Button, look at your iPhone 8, and wait for the Done message and checkmark to finish the process.

## What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone 8 with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your iPhone 8 with Face ID:

### Unlock Your iPhone 8

As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to unlock your iPhone 8 with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:

- **Step1**: Pick your iPhone 8 up in your hands or tap the screen to wake it up.
- **Step2**: Look at the iPhone.
  When the lock symbol changes to the unlocked position, you can swipe up to unlock your iPhone 8 using Face ID and get to the Home Screen.Note that Face ID will not work in landscape mode on an iPhone 8.

### Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your iPhone 8

Face ID allows you to authenticate yourself to make purchases in the App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store and use Apple Pay wherever supported.

### Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

![What is Face ID?](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/5.avif)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and passcode.

- **Step 2**: Toggle Require Attention For Face ID On.

- **Step 3**: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That's it. Now, when you get a call and your iPhone 8 is ringing loud, looking at your iPhone 8 will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your iPhone. Additionally, your iPhone screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### Autofill Passwords and Usernames in Safari and Other Apps

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your iPhone 15/14/13 with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your iPhone to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### Authenticate Yourself for Third-Party Apps

Face ID is also used for authenticating you for third-party apps that support Face ID. This means you can use Face ID to authenticate yourself for banking apps, password managers, and other apps that support Face ID.

### Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the iPhone X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the iPhone and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/6.avif)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 8:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/7.avif)

Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.

Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/8.avif)

Tap Send to send your first Memoji/ Animoji.
