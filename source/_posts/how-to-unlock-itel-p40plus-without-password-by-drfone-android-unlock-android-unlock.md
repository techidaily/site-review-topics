description: The main reason to set up some sort of lock screen security on your Itel P40+ is to keep strangers (or friends) from checking out your messages or private pictures. Beyond that, you don’t want anyone who dares to steal your Itel P40+ to get full access to your mails, pictures or other sensitive data. But what if you’re the one who cannot access your Itel P40+? You could forget your PIN or pattern, right? Or someone pranks you by setting up a lock screen pattern and just leaves you struggling with it.
