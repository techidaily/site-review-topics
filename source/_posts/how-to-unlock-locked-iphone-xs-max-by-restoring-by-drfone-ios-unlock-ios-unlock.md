## Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID

Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.

Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Phone and Activation Lock on the device.

A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won't be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.

![Locked Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/1.webp)

In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user's account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user's account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the device whereas Activation Lock locks the device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

- **Step 3**: Hold your iPhone XS Max in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

There are a few things you can try to resolve this, you can try to update your iPhone XS Max to the latest iOS. At this point, you may even try running a beta version to see if that helps.

## How to Remove Face ID on iPhone XS Max

For all the hardware and software that make for a great experience for nearly all users around the world, Face ID can have its fair share of issues. Sometimes, your face might not get recognized, sometimes it might not work altogether.

Lately, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how Face ID struggles to work for us, and why? Because it cannot scan our faces with masks! So, it makes sense to remove Face ID from our iPhones and rely solely on passcodes. Alternatively, you want to reset your Face ID on your iPhone XS Max and set it again if you have put on some 'COVID weight' owing to working from home.

Most of the time, the best and the simplest thing you can do to resolve your hardware and software issues is to restart the device in question. To restart your iPhone XS Max, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your iPhone XS Max. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your iPhone XS Max to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID and Passcode`.

- **Step 2**: Scroll and tap the option `"Reset Face ID"` to remove Face ID on your iPhone iPhone XS Max.

## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone XS Max 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.
