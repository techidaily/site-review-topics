description: The main reason to set up some sort of lock screen security on your Realme C33 2023 is to keep strangers (or friends) from checking out your messages or private pictures. Beyond that, you don’t want anyone who dares to steal your Realme C33 2023 to get full access to your mails, pictures or other sensitive data. But what if you’re the one who cannot access your Realme C33 2023? You could forget your PIN or pattern, right? Or someone pranks you by setting up a lock screen pattern and just leaves you struggling with it.
