When it comes to downgrading your iOS or iPadOS to an older version, Wondershare Dr.Fone provides a comprehensive set of functions within its tool. You can select the most appropriate version according to the available options. Find out how you can downgrade Apple iOS with the help of Dr.Fone:

- **Step 2**: Backup iDevice If Needed

A prompt will appear asking you to [back up your iOS device data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-backup-and-restore/) before executing this process, as the process normally erases the data of the device. Click **Continue** if you do not bother with the erasing of your data.
