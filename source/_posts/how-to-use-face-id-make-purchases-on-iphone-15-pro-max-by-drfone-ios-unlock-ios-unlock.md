## What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone 15 Pro Max with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your iPhone 15 Pro Max with Face ID:

### Unlock Your iPhone 15 Pro Max

As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro Max with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:

- **Step1**: Pick your iPhone 15 Pro Max up in your hands or tap the screen to wake it up.
- **Step2**: Look at the iPhone.
  When the lock symbol changes to the unlocked position, you can swipe up to unlock your iPhone 15 Pro Max using Face ID and get to the Home Screen.Note that Face ID will not work in landscape mode on an iPhone 15 Pro Max.

### Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your iPhone 15 Pro Max

Face ID allows you to authenticate yourself to make purchases in the App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store and use Apple Pay wherever supported.

### Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

![What is Face ID?](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/5.avif)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and passcode.

- **Step 2**: Toggle Require Attention For Face ID On.

- **Step 3**: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That's it. Now, when you get a call and your iPhone 15 Pro Max is ringing loud, looking at your iPhone 15 Pro Max will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your iPhone. Additionally, your iPhone screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### Autofill Passwords and Usernames in Safari and Other Apps

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your iPhone 15/14/13 with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your iPhone to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### Authenticate Yourself for Third-Party Apps

Face ID is also used for authenticating you for third-party apps that support Face ID. This means you can use Face ID to authenticate yourself for banking apps, password managers, and other apps that support Face ID.

### Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the iPhone X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the iPhone and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/6.avif)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 15 Pro Max:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/7.avif)

Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.

Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/8.avif)

Tap Send to send your first Memoji/ Animoji.

## What is Face ID?

Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad Pro. The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, and accessing sensitive data, as well as providing detailed facial mapping for augmented reality applications.

![What is Face ID?](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/1.avif)

If the new iPhone 15/14/13 is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your iPhone from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the iPhone 13, the iPhone 14, and now the iPhone 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

Face ID is not just for unlocking your iPhone, but it is also used for authenticating you for Apple Pay, App Store purchases, and other third-party apps that support Face ID. It is also used for autofilling passwords and usernames in Safari and other apps.



## How to use Face ID on iPhone 15 Pro Max to make purchases in App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store

- **Step1**: Check if Face ID is enabled for purchases in these stores by going to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode** and ensuring that iTunes and App Store are toggled On.

The instructions are simple: press the side button twice to authenticate yourself using your Face ID and make the purchase.
When done, a satisfying ting and a checkmark will confirm the action.

## How to Set Up Face ID on Your iPhone 15 Pro Max

Sometimes, you may just want to disable Face ID temporarily or the issue gets solved, and want to activate Face ID again. Setting up a Face ID on your iPhone 15 Pro Max is easy. To set up Face ID, sit in a comfortable spot with adequate lighting and follow these steps:

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and Passcode and enter your passcode. If you have not set up a passcode yet, you will necessarily have to create one now before proceeding forward.

- **Step 2**: Tap Set Up Face ID to start the process.

- **Step 3**: Hold your iPhone 15 Pro Max in the portrait orientation at about an arm‘s length away from your face and then tap Get Started.

- **Step 4**: Adjust to have your face inside the shown circle and then slowly rotate your head in a smooth motion to complete the circle. This step will be done one more time.

- **Step 5**: When done, tap Done.

In case you are getting the following error:

![](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/11.avif)

## How to Remove Face ID on iPhone 15 Pro Max

To restart your iPhone 15 Pro Max, long-press the Side Button until the power slider appears and drag it to shut the device off. Then, use the Side Button to start the phone again.

Sometimes, the issues have a way of persisting, and a restart does not resolve them. the TrueDepth system might have developed a fault and Face ID might stop working. Or you got the dreaded "problem detected with TrueDepth camera" message on your iPhone 15 Pro Max. In that case, you would like to know how to reset and remove Face ID on your iPhone 15 Pro Max to see if that helps, before you are required to go to an Apple Store for service.

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID and Passcode`.

- **Step 2**: Scroll and tap the option `"Reset Face ID"` to remove Face ID on your iPhone iPhone 15 Pro Max.

## Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (iPhone 15 Pro Max)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone 15 Pro Max but forgot to erase the device before submitting and consequently, the device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that iPhone 15 Pro Max to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.
