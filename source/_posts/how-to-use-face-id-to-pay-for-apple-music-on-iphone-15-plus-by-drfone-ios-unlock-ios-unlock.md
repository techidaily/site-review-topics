## What Can You Do with Face ID?

Most of us know that we can unlock iPhone 15 Plus with our face via Face ID instead of a thumbprint or passcode. But actually, Face ID does more than just that. Let us learn more cool things you can do with Face ID, which helps you to make a decision if you still want to disable it. Here‘s what you can do on your iPhone 15 Plus with Face ID:

### Unlock Your iPhone 15 Plus

As an authentication mechanism, Face ID enables you to unlock your iPhone 15 Plus with a look. How to do that? Here are the steps:

- **Step1**: Pick your iPhone 15 Plus up in your hands or tap the screen to wake it up.
- **Step2**: Look at the iPhone.
  When the lock symbol changes to the unlocked position, you can swipe up to unlock your iPhone 15 Plus using Face ID and get to the Home Screen.Note that Face ID will not work in landscape mode on an iPhone 15 Plus.

### Making Purchases Using Face ID on Your iPhone 15 Plus

Face ID allows you to authenticate yourself to make purchases in the App Store, Book Store, and iTunes Store and use Apple Pay wherever supported.

### Lowering Ringer and Alarm Volume Automatically

Face ID also enables what Apple calls Attention Aware features that are conveniences afforded to users who have a Face ID enabled iPhone.

![What is Face ID?](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/5.avif)

Setting up and using Attention Aware features is easy:

- **Step 1**: Go to `Settings` > `Face ID` and passcode.

- **Step 2**: Toggle Require Attention For Face ID On.

- **Step 3**: Toggle Attention Aware Features On.

That's it. Now, when you get a call and your iPhone 15 Plus is ringing loud, looking at your iPhone 15 Plus will cause it to lower the volume. When an alarm goes off, you can lower the volume by simply looking at your iPhone. Additionally, your iPhone screen will not dim or switch off for the duration you are looking at it. This means you can now read those books on Kindle without constantly tapping the screen for it to stay awake.

### Autofill Passwords and Usernames in Safari and Other Apps

Face ID also allows users to fill passwords in Safari automatically for a faster and more convenient login experience on your iPhone 15/14/13 with Face ID.

Step 1: Go to Settings > Face ID and Passcode and toggle Password Autofill On.

Step 2: Now, when you use Safari to open a website that requires a login, tapping the username field or password field will bring up the keyboard, and on top of that keyboard there will be your credentials for the website if you have saved them in iCloud Passwords. Tap the credentials.

Step 3: Look at your iPhone to authenticate yourself with Face ID and Safari will autofill the credentials for you.

### Authenticate Yourself for Third-Party Apps

Face ID is also used for authenticating you for third-party apps that support Face ID. This means you can use Face ID to authenticate yourself for banking apps, password managers, and other apps that support Face ID.

### Animojis and Memojis

Up until now, we saw how Face ID enables productivity features and how convenient it is to use it. Now, we come to the fun part - Animojis. Apple launched Face ID in 2017 on the iPhone X with much fanfare and a huge part of that fanfare was Animojis. Over time, Apple brought new capabilities to the iPhone and added Memojis alongside Animojis.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/6.avif)

Animojis are animated emojis. These are made possible with advanced algorithms enabled by the TrueDepth camera in Face ID. Animated emojis or Animojis can mimic your facial expressions and you can use them in your message conversations in apps.

Here‘s how to send Animojis in conversations on your new iPhone 15 Plus:

Step 1: Open a message conversation in the Messages app.

Step 2: Tap the Memoji button (a character in a yellow frame) and swipe to select the desired Animoji/ Memoji you want to send.

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/7.avif)

Step 3: Tap the Record button and you now have 30 seconds to do what you want with your face and the character will reproduce it on screen for you.

Step 4: When done, the Record button changes to Send:

![Animojis and Memojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/8.avif)

Tap Send to send your first Memoji/ Animoji.

## What is Face ID?

Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad Pro. The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, and accessing sensitive data, as well as providing detailed facial mapping for augmented reality applications.

![What is Face ID?](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/how-to-remove-face-id-on-iphone/1.avif)

If the new iPhone 15/14/13 is your first-ever iPhone, or if you have neither upgraded your iPhone from the 6/7/8 series nor have kept abreast with the happenings in the Apple world, you might wonder what this newfangled thing called Face ID is.

Face ID is an authentication system that came with iPhone X for the first time, and then the iPhone 13, the iPhone 14, and now the iPhone 15. Like Touch ID that uses your fingerprints, Face ID uses your face metrics to authenticate you for everything, the way Touch ID does.

Face ID is not a new and advanced version of Touch ID, but a completely different authentication system that utilizes a different component what Apple calls a TrueDepth camera to scan your face metrics. Face ID is not available on phones with Touch ID (iPhone SE 2022 today) and Touch ID is not available on iPhones that come with Face ID as their authentication mechanism.

Face ID is not just for unlocking your iPhone, but it is also used for authenticating you for Apple Pay, App Store purchases, and other third-party apps that support Face ID. It is also used for autofilling passwords and usernames in Safari and other apps.
