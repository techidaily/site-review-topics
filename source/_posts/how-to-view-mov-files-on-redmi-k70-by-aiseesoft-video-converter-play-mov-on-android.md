  “Hi guys, I just changed for the Xiaomi Redmi K70 about half a month ago and I'm very pleased with it and don't regret leaving Apple, saving for iTunes compatibility. Anyways can anyone please tell me if there's a way I could play my .mov videos taken with my old iPhone on my Xiaomi Redmi K70? Thanks.”

To download a .mov player for your Xiaomi Redmi K70, you can give VLC player, MX Player, BS Player and Mobo player a shot. To convert MOV files for viewing on Xiaomi Redmi K70, you can give Video Converter a shot. You load your MOV files to this Converter app, and choose H.264 MP4 as output format. This will ensure the converted files have a good playback performance on your Xiaomi Redmi K70.
