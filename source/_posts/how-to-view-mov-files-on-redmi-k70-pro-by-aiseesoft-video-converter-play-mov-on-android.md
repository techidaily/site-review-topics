  “Hi guys, I just changed for the Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro about half a month ago and I'm very pleased with it and don't regret leaving Apple, saving for iTunes compatibility. Anyways can anyone please tell me if there's a way I could play my .mov videos taken with my old iPhone on my Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro? Thanks.”
