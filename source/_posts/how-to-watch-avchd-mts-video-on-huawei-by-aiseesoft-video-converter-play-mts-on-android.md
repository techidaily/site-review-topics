    Surprised to find that your Huawei Nova Y91 does not come with native support for AVCHD .MTS format used in many video cameras? By installing a third party media player like MX player will solve your problem. If this doesn’t work or you prefer to use the stock player, you can convert AVCHD files to MP4 format for playing on Huawei Nova Y91.
