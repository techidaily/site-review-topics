Your iPhone is a trove of personal data — photos, videos, passwords, ID proofs, bank details, chats, messages, contacts, and a lot more— which, naturally, you don’t want to fall into other hands. That’s why you prefer to delete all the information on your iPhone before selling it to others.

But several iPhone recovery software can easily restore deleted data from an old or discarded iPhone. So there’s always a fear that someone could recover your iPhone’s data and misuse it.

Here’s a solution — permanently wipe iPhone data beyond the scope of recovery by any software.

## **How do you permanently erase data from your iPhone?**

Manual deletion is one of the ways to remove data. But it can be easily recovered by iPhone features like restoring ‘Recently Deleted’ or recovery software.

Then, Apple suggests resetting the content and settings of the iOS device. It’s effective as the deleted data is not accessible directly on your iPhone. But this also does not completely erase your data from iPhone storage.

So to wipe iPhones permanently, specialized erasure software should be used. The iPhone data erasure tool destroys all information on your storage by overwriting, thus rendering it unrecoverable.

## **Methods to** **erase everything on iPhone**

1. Reset content and settings on iPhone **(data gets inaccessible but recoverable)**
2. Use iPhone data erasure software – Stellar Toolkit for iPhone **(permanently wipes iPhone’s data, unrecoverable)**

### **Method 1: Reset content and settings on iPhone**

Apple provides a factory reset feature in iPhone with the ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ option. This method lets you bring your device to default settings by erasing iPhone data.

Apple’s factory reset will delete all settings, passcodes, photos, videos, notes, contacts, call history, messages, search history, app history, and other data on your iPhone.

However, erasing your iPhone with the ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ option does not delete your data permanently. All the personal data on iPhone is still recoverable with the help of [advanced iPhone data recovery software.](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/)

##### **Steps to Factory Reset iPhone:**

1. **Open** **Settings** on your iPhone.
2. Tap and follow **General > Reset**.
3. Tap on **Erase All Content and Settings**.
4. A dialog box appears; click **Erase Now**.
5. Enter your Passcode and your Apple ID password when prompted. This will wipe iPhone completely and turn off the device.

Now your device is ready to use as new without any personal photos, videos, or other information.

**Note:** Back up your iPhone data on iCloud or iTunes before performing a factory reset. Even when you want to sell the iPhone, the old data remains in iCloud and iTunes. And you can access it anytime on your computer or new iPhone.

### **Method 2: Erase data permanently using Stellar Toolkit for iPhone**

When you want to delete iPhone data permanently beyond the scope of any recovery software, use an iPhone erasure tool – **[Stellar Toolkit for iPhone.](https://www.stellarinfo.com/erase-iphone-data.php)**

The factory reset option by Apple does leave a chance of iPhone data recovery by using the software. But, Stellar Toolkit for iPhone software permanently resets iPhone. The software erases iPhone data from the storage drive by overwriting and setting it to the original default settings. The software leaves no possibility of recovering data by any means.

You can quickly remove iPhone’s settings, photos, videos, audio, music, contacts, messages, chats, installed apps, call history, reminders, search history, and other data.

**The software works with all iPhones and iPads. It can wipe off data from iPhone 15, 14, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max, 13, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, XS MAX, XS, XR, X, 8, 7, 7s, 6s, 6 Plus, 6, 5s, 5c, 5, 4s, and 4. It supports iOS 6.0 and up to iOS 16.x.**

Stellar iPhone erasure lets you completely wipe data from an unlimited number of iPhones with the software.
