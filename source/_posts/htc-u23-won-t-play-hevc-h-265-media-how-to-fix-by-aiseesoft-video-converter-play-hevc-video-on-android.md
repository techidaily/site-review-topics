      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your HTC U23, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your HTC U23 cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your HTC U23 would be a workable solution.

    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on HTC U23 and it failed terribly. Does HTC U23 come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my HTC U23 on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
