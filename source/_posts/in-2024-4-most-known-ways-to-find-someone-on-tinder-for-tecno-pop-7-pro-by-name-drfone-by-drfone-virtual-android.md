### Method 4: Change Your Country on YouTube Using a SmartDNS

Using SmartDNS to bypass YouTube geo-restrictions is useful for viewing blocked content in your country. This is because SmartDNS changes the Tecno Pop 7 Pro device's virtual location by editing its DNS address. Here are the steps to change your country on YouTube using SmartDNS.

**Step 1**: Find and select a DNS Server address from different DNS providers online. In this example, we'll be using [SurfShark](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjT8sr_zZ78AhUTq5YKHcKQCYgYABAAGgJ0bA&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESbeD2dKiM2ygqHdaqahKERHTJ_CnwejUHvpE3gMIDLDTBCKsdW7uhDEtgdujHUQYICZygX8gTFHfkjSBccZQzOpaYccTvCMgWjq6yvWIUGIURawRARLqFvpncCpdGHAF7Fhkqh2LpPP8UEX1GlcQ&sig=AOD64_25VQlpaayR9IoDrhxfRpwHPn9Eqw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjDk8T_zZ78AhXSUN4KHbgVB4MQ0Qx6BAgJEAE).

**Step 2**: Login or create an account. Click **Smart DNS** \> **Activate Smart DNS**. Take note of the DNS address available to input on your computer's **Network Settings**.

**Step 3**: Open **Network Settings** on your computer and find **DNS Settings.**

**Step 4**: Input your DNS Server address and click **Ok** once done. The DNS address should activate once you reconnect to the internet.

**_Note_****_:_** _Your IP address changes every 24 hours, which your ISP does. You'll have to update your DNS address when it happens._

### Method 5: Other Ways to Bypass YouTube's Regional Filter

The easiest way to bypass YouTube's regional filter is simply by downloading YouTube videos outright. Many websites are available online that allow you to download YouTube clips for free. In the step-by-step guide below, we'll be using iTubeGo to download YouTube videos for viewing at a later time.

**Step 1**: Download and install [iTubeGo](https://itubego.com/4k-youtube-video-downloader64/). Launch the application on your computer.

![download youtube videos with itubego](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/download-youtube-itubego.jpg)

**Step 2**: Click **Paste URL** and paste the YouTube video's **URL** on the dialogue box.

**Step 3**: Click **Download** to save the YouTube clip on your computer.

Here are the pros and cons of using each method to unblock geo-restricted content on YouTube.

| **Pros & Cons** | **Manually on YouTube TV** | **Using VPNs** | **Using Proxy Servers** | **Using SmartDNS** | **Offline Downloads** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pros** | You can easily change locations without downloading other applications. | Change countries on-the-fly to access even more content. | Some Proxy Servers don't require downloading applications to use. | Unblocks geo-restricted content, much like VPNs. | You can always watch videos at a later time once downloaded. |
| **Cons** | You're only allowed to change twice a month. | VPNs aren't free, and you have to pay for a subscription. | Setting up Proxy Servers requires a little bit of technical know-how. | DNS is prone to manipulation by hackers. | You need to download a dedicated program to save YouTube videos. |

## Part 3: Why Do Regions Block YouTube Content?

Although all YouTube videos are hosted on the same platform, a lot of them are geo-restricted to specific countries for various reasons. Many YouTubers sometimes lock their content in certain countries/regions due to licensing rights. YouTube may also block specific content to countries/regions to comply with local laws.

### Conclusion

There are multiple ways to change your country on YouTube to access content that is otherwise unavailable in your location. You can change your country in settings on the YouTube app or use other methods, including using VPNs, SmartDNS, or Proxy Servers, to name a few. If all else fails, you can download an application that lets you save YouTube videos for offline viewing at a later time.

2. For this, fire up the “Terminal”over your Mac and then execute the commands as follows:

- git config --global user.email "<you@example.com>"
- git config --global user.name "your name"

**Note:** Change the values for “<you@example.com>”and “your name” with your information.

![Change the values](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg)

6. Next, you need to make sure that to set up a development team and meanwhile, connect your Tecno Pop 7 Pro to your Mac computer.

    ![connect iphone to mac](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg)

7. Once done, opt it in as the build device and while you do it, ensure to keep it unlocked.

Step 3: Move Bitmoji

Now, you’re all set to fake location for Snapchat map. For this, simply hit on the “Debug” menu and then opt for “Simulate Location” from the drop-down window. Lastly, select the location from the list as per your preference and you’re done.

## Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android

Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Tecno Pop 7 Pro. Here’s all that you need to do.

1. Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the “fake GPS” app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Tecno Pop 7 Pro to be rooted.
2. You need to opt for the “Fakegps free” app for Snapchat. This app doesn’t require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.
3. Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, you’ll be asked to“ENABLE MOCK LOCATIONS”. Hit on it and you’ll be redirected to the“Developer options” screen.
4. Here, you need to simply tap on the “Select Mock Location App” option and opt for “FakeGPS Free” from the list of options appearing.

    ![FakeGPS Free](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg)

**Note:** You may need to enable the “Developer options” first to access these settings. For this, head to the “Settings”>“About Phone”> hit on “Build Number” – x7 times.

6. Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.
7. Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.
8. Lastly, hit the “play” button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.
