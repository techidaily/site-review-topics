## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Infinix Hot 30 5G

Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
