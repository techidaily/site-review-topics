At this point, instructions change depending on the Lava Yuva 2 Pro device you connected. There are different instructions for iPhone and Android. Please visit [this](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/connect-android-ios-device-to-fake-location.html) link to connect your specific device.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world. However, in location-based games, you need to be seen walking or moving around in the environment. In that case, use the One-stop Route mode.

Here’s how to simulate movement using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to play location-based games.

Click the third option from the top right to enter One-stop Route mode. Enter a location to teleport to and click Move Here (1).

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.
