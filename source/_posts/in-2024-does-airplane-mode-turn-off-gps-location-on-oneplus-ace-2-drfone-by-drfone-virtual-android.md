## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On OnePlus Ace 2?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the OnePlus Ace 2 devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your OnePlus Ace 2** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on OnePlus Ace 2s?

To hide the location on your OnePlus Ace 2 and iPad, below listed are the steps.

**Step 1**. Open the Control Center on your iDevice, iPhone 13 for example. (For iPhone X and above models, swipe down from the top-right, while on other devices, swipe from the bottom of the screen)

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the OnePlus Ace 2 devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

## Part 4: Spoof Location to prevent GPS Tracing without Turning on Airplane Mode

If you are looking for a method that can prevent GPS tracking without turning on Airplane Mode, spoofing your location is a workable solution.

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the OnePlus Ace 2 device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the OnePlus Ace 2 device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.

## Will iSpoofer update On OnePlus Ace 2

iSpoofer has been one of the most in-demand applications for changing your location while playing Pokemon Go. For all the right reasons, people wanted to stick to it to make sure that they catch the splendid Pokemon no matter where they are stationed. But the problems started when iSpoofer stopped working and there was no way anyone could continue to use or initiate iSpoofer update. When you open the application, you’d either see an error message, a subtle hint at an apology, or a pop-up that says that the app is under maintenance.

![ispoofer shut down pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-shut-down-pic-1.jpg)

All of them are the alternative ways of saying - ‘We are not available anymore’. But will iSpoofer be back in the year 2021? Can we expect to revive our Pokemon catching abilities with the iSpoofer update? Even if it comes back, will it be available for Android and iPhone users? If not - then do we have any other application that we can use for this purpose? To get answers to all these questions, you have to continue to read this space.

## Part 1: Why Can’t I update iSpoofer?

![ispoofer not able to log in pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/ispoofer-not-able-to-log-in-pic-2.jpg)

To put it very simple and upfront - The reason why you are unable to update iSpoofer is that it has been shut down. You can no longer use the existing application on the phone or download it from their website. Initially, when the app was down, people thought it could have been a Pogo update that is causing the error. So, they uninstalled the app and tried to download it again from the official website of the iSpoofer app. To their disappointment, the error message showed up even then. It took a while for everyone to accept that the application was no longer available and their desperate attempts to get it to work went in vain.

![Ispoofer error message pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-error-message-pic-3.jpg)

Undoubtedly, iSpoofer was a ‘game’ changer in the literal sense. You didn’t have to move from your place, you can catch some rare Pokemon and you get additional points for being the active wanderer. It’s of course a ‘cheat route’ to play the game and it has finally come to the notice of Niantic that a third-party app is being used to play the game.

Now that didn’t go down well with the makers. The whole essence of Pokemon Go is to ‘Go Out’ from the house to explore the presence of Pokemons in the surroundings. So, having a third-party application is going to change a lot of things. Pokemon blacklisted the app.

![Ispoofer account suspension pic](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Ispoofer-account-suspension-pic-4.jpg)

The main target users for iSpoofer were the Pokemon Go players. With them gone, the revenue and usage of the app have reduced to a great extent and the creators have decided to pull the app out. And that is why you will no longer find a new version of iSpoofer that will be compatible with the game. The older version has anyway been blacklisted and won’t be of any use for the players and no iSpoofer update information so far

Even in 2021, there is no guarantee that the app will be back so it’s better to not keep the hopes up. The major business for the app could have been in 2020 when the world stayed home. However, if everyone was unable to download and update the app in the year 2020, there are very bleak chances of having it back in 2021.

## Part 2: Is there a good alternative for iSpoofer?

There are quite a few ways to spoof your location in the Pokemon Go Game but then they narrow down to even smaller numbers when we start searching for the ‘reliable’ options. So, here are a few ways you can find a good alternative for iSpoofer.

**VPNs -** There are certain VPNs that offer in-built location spoofing features that might come in handy for playing games like Pokemon Go. They change your location on the rest of the internet so it might be a little tricky for the makers to catch the foul play.

![VPNs-pic-5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPNs-pic-5.jpg)

Google Play Store Apps - There are certain applications you will find on Google Play Store or even the App store that offer ‘Fake GPS’ changes. You simply have to search for ‘Fake GPS Location Changers’ and you get some options. Find the one with the best rating and this can work for a while. However, there is no guarantee of when they’ll abandon you.

![Google-play-store-apps-pic-6](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Google-play-store-apps-pic-6.jpg)

The most reliable option that you can go for is using - Dr. Fone. It is Wondershare’s master app that changes your location on the world map, the very same will reflect on all your devices, social media accounts, and internet searches. It’s very hard to detect that you’ve used a spoofer. This is how to use it -

**Step 1 -** You can use the [Dr.Fone Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html)Spoofer for both Android and iPhones. So, starting off, you need to connect your OnePlus Ace 2 (the phone) to your system - be it a laptop or a computer. You will be prompted to accept the ‘Terms and Conditions and then click on ‘Get Started’.

![drfone-change-location-pic-7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/drfone-change-location-pic-7.jpg)

**Step 2 -** Once you are in, then the page will display a map and your location will be clearly mentioned. You need to go to the Teleport Mode you will find on the top right corner of the page. Enter your new location on the map.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-8.jpg)

**Step 3 -** You can use the coordinates to get to the location or once the map displays, you can zoom in and move the pointer from one place to another and then click on ‘Move Here’ so that the location will be shifted from the previous one to new.

![Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Drfone-virtual-location-pic-9.jpg)

**Step 4 -** Now it’s easier to launch Pokemon Go but give it a few minutes before your changed location is completely registered and keep the new location realistic.

As in, you can’t jump from Russia to America in 2 hours, can you?

![change-location-registered-pic-10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-location-registered-pic-10.jpg)

It’s quite easy to spoof your location for games like Pokemon Go using Dr. Fone and it will even stay undetected if you do it the right way. Also, the whole process to change the location hardly takes a few minutes, so you don’t have to spend time understanding how it all works. While you wait for the iSpoofer update (which may or may not come) you can use this in the meantime.

## Can Life360 Track You When Your OnePlus Ace 2 is off?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Did you know that your OnePlus Ace 2 tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your OnePlus Ace 2 can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your OnePlus Ace 2, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your OnePlus Ace 2 is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your OnePlus Ace 2 and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your OnePlus Ace 2 and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

## Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life. An issue with your Internet connection will come up instead of location stopped in this situation. So don't connect to any Wi-Fi at all.

### 2\. Fake Locations

Using location spoofing applications on an Android smartphone, your kids can fool you into thinking they're somewhere else. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location spoofing application that will trick you into thinking that you are in a different location than you really are. The GPS position of the OnePlus Ace 2 device will be updated to reflect the new place that you have chosen thanks to the software. It is worth noting that Dr. Fone - Virtual Location for iOS may also enable you to imitate GPS movement.

It has several other noticeable features that can help you in your daily life.

![access virtual location feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Conclusion

Can you track a phone if the location is off? Life360 has become a standard feature of many smartphones. Parents often use it to monitor their children's location. The fact that Life360 can be used to track users is quite disturbing. The good news is that there are ways to stop Life360 from tracking you. The best and all-in-one solution is a third-party application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/drfone-toolkit.html).
