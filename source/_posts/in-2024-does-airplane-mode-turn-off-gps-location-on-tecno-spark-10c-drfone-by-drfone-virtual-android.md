## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Tecno Spark 10C?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Tecno Spark 10C devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your Tecno Spark 10C** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi.Â So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on Tecno Spark 10Cs?

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the Tecno Spark 10C devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the Tecno Spark 10C device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the Tecno Spark 10C device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.

And in case you are unable to access any particular song or album, that can be because of your location too, If you are planning on Spotify Change Location, then here are 6 effective ways that will instantly get the job done or you, no matter where you are in the world.

## **Part 1: By-Passing geo Restrictions in Spotify**

Before we find out about the 6 different ways to update location Spotify, let us understand why it is important to by-pass these geo-restrictions and what are these hindrances in the first place.

**Region Specific Content**

![region specific spotify content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-Spotify-content-pic1.jpg)

The main reason anyone would want to change their Spotify location is when they change countries. If you want to access content relevant to this new region, it is best to go with Spotify Change Country. When you change our spotify location, you will get the regionally most-played songs or most liked podcasts as suggestions. This way, you can access quality content of this place that youâve shifted to.

**Geo-Based Suggestions**

![sopify playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/playlist-spotify-pic2.jpg)

Now, your coordinates can decide what kind of playlists Spotify compiles for you. The music streaming app can surprise its fans by bringing together some of the best songs from the region. Depending upon your location, only the most liked songs of that location are brought together. This makes life easier for those who like to listen to songs and content in their regional languages.

**But is Spotify available everywhere?**

How we wish this was true! However, Spotify is not available in all the countries. Though ts has decided to extend its services to most of the Asian and European countries, currently, it is available in roughly 65 countries only. By the end of 2021, it might be available in over 170 countries, Until then, tweaking location becomes important.

The problem with Spotify update location is that - you can only change your country when you installed Spotify in a particular country and then shifted to a new one. If you are trying to change location within the same geographical boundaries, it doesnât support those actions. Also, the free users have to change their location manually while the Premium Subscribers can access the content available in all the Spotify Hosting countries.

## **Part 2: Best Tools to Fake GPS on iPhone**

Most of the users want to make the best use of this tremendously efficient Music-streaming app. It is having a keen eye for quality audio and also hosts some of the best podcasts and content.
