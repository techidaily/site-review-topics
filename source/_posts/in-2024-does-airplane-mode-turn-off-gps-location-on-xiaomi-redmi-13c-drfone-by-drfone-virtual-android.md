## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Xiaomi Redmi 13C?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Xiaomi Redmi 13C devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on Xiaomi Redmi 13Cs?

To hide the location on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C and iPad, below listed are the steps.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-1.jpg)

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the Xiaomi Redmi 13C devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

## Part 4: Spoof Location to prevent GPS Tracing without Turning on Airplane Mode

![move here on virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the Xiaomi Redmi 13C device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.

## Will the iPogo Get You Banned and How to Solve It On Xiaomi Redmi 13C

Pokemon Go has graced one of the most popular mobile games right from the day it was launched. It requires players to move around one place to the other in reality to capture Pokémon. But if you don’t want to go out of his way and search for Pokémon then iPogo is a tool for you. It is a location spoofer that can change the location of your device. It allows you to move from one place to another with just one-tap. As it is a cheat tool, you might want to know can iPogo get you banned? There are chances of getting an iPogo ban, but they are relatively high depending on how you use the tool.

![ipogo ban intro](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-ban-intro.jpg)

## Part 1: How does the iPogo work for pokemon

iPogo comes with tons of add-on features that can be used to boost your Pokémon collection 10 folds. But it does that by breaking many rules and regulations created by Niantic. Here are some features of iPogo for Pokemon Go that are not by the books:

- **Play from anywhere, anytime:**

iPogo allows users to play Pokemon go anytime from anywhere in the world. All you will require is a decent internet connection, and you are good to go. And this is something that Niantic strongly opposes.

- **Spoofing:**

Niantic has arranged several ban waves once a week for players who were found cheating. The humorous thing to note here is that most of such players were caught spoofing. And this app lets you do exactly that. This also had a stimulating effect on the iPogo ban rates.

- **It works like a Go-Plus**

This app works like a virtual go-plus, enabling your device to change its location via switching servers. But that doesn’t assure any safety from the likes of Niantic.

- **Third-party software**

This app also works as a third-party software as it runs in the background while you are playing the game. Sometimes Niantic can detect that as well, and you might have to face an iPogo ban.

## Part 2: What’s the rate of iPogo ban

![ipogo ban intro 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-ban-intro-2.jpg)

Players mostly use iPogo for location spoofing, which is very common in Pokémon go. Niantic releases various patch notes to stop players from spoofing and catch those who are doing it. In Pokémon Go players, are banned on a 3-Strike basis.

If you are using iPogo as a location spoofer, kindly note that it is perilous to do that. If you receive the 1st strike as an iPogo ban, I strongly suggest you never use iPogo again because Niantic will keep a close watch on you. So if your question is, can iPogo get me banned? Then yes, it definitely can.

## Part 3: How to avoid getting banned by Pokemon Go while using a fake GPS tool?

Using a fake GPS tool in Pokemon Go is against the game's terms of service and can result in a ban. However, if you want to avoid getting banned, here are some tips to help you avoid getting banned while [faking Pokemon Go GPS](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-pokemon-go.html):

1. **Avoid suspicious behavior:** Niantic monitors player activities for any unusual or suspicious behavior. Avoid sudden changes in your location, and jumping between distant places within a short period, as these actions can raise red flags and increase the risk of a ban.

2. **Be aware of detection methods:** Niantic employs various detection methods to identify players who are using fake GPS tools or engaging in spoofing activities. These methods can include analyzing movement patterns, comparing location data with known landmarks, or detecting inconsistencies in player behavior. It's important to understand that detection methods can evolve, and it's difficult to completely avoid detection.

3. **Stay informed:** Keep yourself updated with Pokémon Go's terms of service and any changes or announcements made by Niantic. They may introduce new measures to combat cheating, and being aware of these updates can help you avoid unintentional violations.

4. **Use a trusted tool:** When using a fake GPS tool for Pokémon Go, it is crucial to choose a reliable and trusted app. Avoid using any random or unverified GPS spoofing apps. There is a reliable is recommended in the following part. Read on!

## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer.

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.
