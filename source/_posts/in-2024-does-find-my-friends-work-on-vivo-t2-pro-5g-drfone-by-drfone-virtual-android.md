Viber is one of the most commonly used messenger apps. It allows you to send short messages like texts, videos, images, audio, and documents. Viber also has another exciting feature that will enable you to share your location. But sometimes, you might want to **change location on Viber** to prank your friends or for security purposes. So, read on to learn how to **fake location on Viber** with some simple solutions.

## Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?

If you’ve used WhatsApp’s location feature before, you’ll know what Viber’s “My Location” is all about. With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.

But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Vivo T2 Pro 5G/Android browser. Therefore, you can send a location on Viber without knowing. This can be advantageous to stalkers or even cause misunderstanding in your relationship. What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send. But fret not because this post will help you **disable or enable My Location on Viber** according to your needs.

## Part 2: How to disable or enable My Location on Viber?

So, without wasting too much time, let’s find out the steps to disable/enable Viber location-sharing feature. It’s straightforward.

Step 1. Fire up your Viber app on mobile or PC and tap the **Chats** button. Here, proceed to open a chat that you want to enable/disable location sharing.

![change location on Viber open chats](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-1.jpg)

Step 2. Next, tap the **Ellipsis** (three dots) icon at the top-right corner of the screen and choose **Chat Info**. Alternatively, simply swipe the screen to the left.

![change location on Viber, tap chat info](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-2.jpg)

![change location on Viber share location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg)

## Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?

So, is it possible to **Viber's fake location**? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.

But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).

## Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?

Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.

Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.
