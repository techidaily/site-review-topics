Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.

The app does not notify when circle members check someone's location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.

As long as the location sharing is on, circle members will get a notification when someone turns their location off. Suppose someone's phone is dead, or there is a poor connection.

## Part 1: How Does Chrome Know Your Location?

Before discussing Google **Chrome's fake location**, it is important to know how Chrome detects your physical location. Google Chrome uses many ways to pinpoint your exact location, like your IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cell Tower data. Every internet connection has an IP address bound to a location that enables Chrome to identify your location.

Similarly, GPS location can easily be tracked if your phone device has it enabled. All the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections around you also have location information embedded in them. They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.

## Part 2: How to Hide Location Services in Chrome?

If you are worried about Google Chrome detecting your physical location and sharing it with websites and apps, you can hide it easily. The process of hiding your location on Google Chrome is simple, even if you are using multiple devices. Below is the step-by-step process of hiding location services in Google Chrome on computer, Android, and iOS devices.

### Method 1: For Laptop and Desktop PCs

### Method 3. Fake Your Location Using Chrome Extension

Many **fake location Chrome extensions** are available on Google Chrome which can be used to alter your location on Chrome. You can find these extensions on Google Chrome Web Store and add them directly to your browser. Below we have explained the steps for using such an extension "[Location Guard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/location-guard/cfohepagpmnodfdmjliccbbigdkfcgia?hl=en)" to fake your location on Google Chrome:

**Step 1:** Open the "Location Guard" on Chrome Web Store and click "Add to Chrome" to add it to your browser. Once the "Location Guard" extension is added, open it and press "Options."

![confirm the fixed location position](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-16.jpg)

**Limitations**

- Location Guard doesn't protect your IP address. It means some websites can still detect your real location using the IP address.
- The app is not updated for quite a while, that's why the map of the fixed location feature is quite restricted.

### Method 4. Spoof Your IP Using a VPN Server

Another way you can fool websites and your browser by displaying a **fake location online** is to use a VPN server. VPNs fake your IP address to fool websites and apps into detecting your location. [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) is a VPN that can be used to spoof your IP by following these steps:

**Step 2:** If you want to just change the location of your device, you can select "Quick Connect." Using it will enable the program to automatically find the most suited fake location for you.

![tap on the quick connect button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-hide-or-fake-your-location-in-google-chrome-browser-17.jpg)
