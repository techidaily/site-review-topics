## Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Realme 11X 5G?

Life360 is an excellent family security service provider that notifies family members and loved ones about the user's temporary location with GPS tracking and action alerts. In addition, life360 uses texts and notifications to help circle members keep track of everyone's location, driving habits, and frequently visited places. Still, most people don't use the app because they think it restricts them with message tracking and other features that look familiar to some spying apps. For those who want to know does life360 notify when you log out, you will find out everything about that in this article.

Life360 can track your device's location and texts, but it can't read your texts, and people outside your circle can't view your location, so your privacy is safe using this app. All circle members get a location paused notification when logging out or turning off the location. Read till the end to learn how various life360 features work and can you log into life360 on a computer. We also have solutions to turn off locations without others knowing on any family tracking app.

## Part 1: How does the life360 location work?

Life360 gives a peace-of-mind to you and your family members by tracking your location, so everyone in your circle knows where is the other person and what are they doing; if the user is driving, then everyone will get a notification about their driving habits, and circle members can check location data history. All the circle members must have the life360 app downloaded and running in the background of their devices. Circle members can see the exact location of the user when the location services are on. Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.

Its one-tap location features allow circle members to see everyone's location data on the map. The app gives a route to the other person's current location by tapping any member pointer. If someone is in danger or got an emergency, they can tap the panic button to send a mass text to the circle with their location. The app does not notify when circle members check someone's location history. Life360 notifies circle members when someone turns their location off, text while driving, drive carelessly, or stops the app.

## Part 2: Does life360 notify when you leave?

As the best family locator app, life360 notifies circle members about any user's security or app-related activities. In addition, the app notifies all circle members when someone leaves or is removed from the circle. Does life360 notify when you log in to a new device? Yes, it does. The user can log into multiple devices but only once at a time. As soon as the user changes devices, everyone gets a notification with the new device's location.

There are multiple life160 notifications for different scenarios. Everyone gets a "user removed" notification when a user leaves a circle. As long as the location sharing is on, circle members will get a notification when someone turns their location off. Suppose someone's phone is dead, or there is a poor connection. In that case, life360 puts an exclamation mark next to that user's name to notify other circle members.

## Part 3: How to turn off location on life360 without anyone knowing?

Although life360 provides excellent family location services, it also affects your privacy by tracking your location and texts as long as the phone and location services are on. It is the same for other family tracking apps. For example, suppose users want to attend to some private matters or want others to respect their privacy. The best way is to turn off their location on life360 so no one can track them, but it is not an option because you can't do that on life360. Using a third-party location-changer app is the best solution in this case.

![change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/images2023/virtual-location.png)

Do you find it hard to look for places without an active internet connection? Well, in this case, you should consider using a route generator app. For instance, with a reliable GPX file generator, you can easily track a route offline. This can help you navigate your way without an active internet connection or even let you excel in games like Pokemon Go. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know about running route generator and Pokemon map generator apps in detail.

In nutshell, a route generator app would help you navigate from one point on the map to another. Though, these apps have some add-one features compared to any run-of-the-mill navigation app. With the help of a GPX file generator feature, they can just export your mapped route offline. In this way, you can simply import the GPX file again (on the same or another map) and navigate your way without any active internet connection.

GPS navigation has changed a lot of the things that we do on a day-to-day basis.

Instead of planning your route a few days in advance, you can find the safest route with just a few taps on your phone, giving you more time to focus on other things.

While using your phone to track your current location, you might have noticed that it is not showing you the correct location. It will confuse you but it does happen from time to time, and there will be fixes that you can do get to track properly. There are also multiple factors that you will need to consider when you encounter an issue where your phone has shown you a completely different location compared to where you are. We will talk about those possible issues and how you can fix them and get them to work properly again.

## Part 1: Why is My Location Wrong on My Realme 11X 5G?

As we have mentioned earlier, there are multiple reasons why your location is not being tracked accurately by your phone. We understand how crucial to ensure that the location is accurate, especially if you are using this to send someone something or if you plan to go somewhere.

### _Reason #1:_ The location services are disabled on your phone

The most basic common reason as to why your current location is wrong is that you could have disabled the GPS or location services on your phone.

### _Reason #2:_ Internet connectivity on your mobile is unstable

Another common issue as to why your location is wrong on your phone is that your mobile's connectivity is unstable. This could be due to your mobile provider, or the location that you currently are in might not have any stable internet connection and is causing your location to be wrong.

### _Reason #3:_ Your mobile phone might not be updated

Another reason your phone has the incorrect location would be that your phone is updated to the latest software update. The software update will usually include fixes to the old software update's bugs.

### _Reason #4:_ The “Location Services” might not be enabled for the application

If you have not enabled the application to use the GPS, then it will not show you the correct location. Make sure to check whether this application can access the “Location Services” by following the steps below.

## Part 2: How to Fix Realme 11X 5G Location Accuracy Issue?

Now that you know the possible causes of why you have an incorrect location, we will not share with you the fixes that you can do to get a more accurate location when you use your phone.

### _Option #1:_ Enable the “Location Services” on your phone

Similar to your iOS, the application needs to also be updated, so double-check if the application needs to be updated as well. You can do this by going to the App Store and checking if the application needs to be updated and if it does, do update the app and you can retry tracking your location after.

### _Option #4:_ Enable the “Location Services” for your phone

Double-check if the location services are turned on on your phone so it will show you an accurate location.

- **_Step 1:_** Open the “Settings” on your phone and scroll down to look for “Privacy” then tap on it.
