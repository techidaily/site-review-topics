## Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Vivo Y200e 5G?

Life360 is an excellent family security service provider that notifies family members and loved ones about the user's temporary location with GPS tracking and action alerts.

Does life360 notify you when you leave a circle? Yes, it sends a notification to all circle members when someone leaves.
