#### 5\. iSpoofer

![ispoofer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/mock-location-6.jpg)

Probably one of the most known apps at one point in time, iSpoofer was great at spoofing location on iPhone until Niantic, the makers of Pokémon GO, detected the app, and banned it. The app still works with some tricks up its sleeve, but we do not really recommend it, given that it was detected once and if you are detected using the app, you will be banned from the Poke-verse for good.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location can be used to effectively spoof GPS coordinates on Android devices as well. An issue that other spoofing apps present is that the location might jump between its true location and falsified location, which means that other apps might present a location spoofing solution that is not stable. That is not the case with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (Android) where a location once set remains set as long as you want it to, and will not jump.

Step 4: After you have connected your respective device, now comes the fun part – spoofing your location! If you want to simply prank your friends or use dating apps and other apps where you simply want a different location, you can use the Jump Teleport mode to simply change your location to anywhere in the world. However, in location-based games, you need to be seen walking or moving around in the environment. In that case, use the One-stop Route mode.

Here’s how to simulate movement using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to play location-based games.

Click the third option from the top right to enter One-stop Route mode. Enter a location to teleport to and click Move Here (1).

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

\- One precaution to take when you spoof your location in general is to allow a cooling period before changing location, and once you change your location to anywhere in the world, do not jump to another far-off place the next minute or even the next hour. Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.
