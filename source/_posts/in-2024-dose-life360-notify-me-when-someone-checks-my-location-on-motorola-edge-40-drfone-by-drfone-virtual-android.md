Life360 hack - Here are some methods to stop sharing your location without them knowing.

### Method 1: Invest in a Burner Phone

Using an anonymous burner phone purchased with cash is a standard plot device in espionage movies and programs. There is a method that is the same as this for faking Life360.

**Step 1.** Your existing log-in information will work just as well when installing Life360 on your backup phone.

**Step 2.** When you arrive at your destination, connect your burner phone to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 3.** Don't use Life360 anymore on your phone.

![ invest in a burner phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Disable Wi-Fi and Cellular Data Access

Turning down the Motorola Edge 40 device's potential to interact with Wi-Fi and cellular networks is another option for generating a false location.

**Step 1.** To prevent applications from renewing themselves in the background, you must use the option that saves battery life.

![ disable wi-fi and cellular data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-2.jpg)

**Step 2.** Disconnect from the internet through Wi-Fi and cellular data if you have them. For example, rather than disabling the whole Android system on an iPhone, you may simply disable the Life 360 app.

**Step 3.** Navigate to the settings menu, look for the Life360 option, and then off cellular data, background refresh, and the Motion & Fitness feature.

![ disable wi-fi and cellular data access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-your-location-3.jpg)

## Part VI: Tips To Avoid Detection

Using a method that has been detected once, such as iSpoofer, is one way to land in trouble. How to go undetected when spoofing locations? Use these tips.

\- The best way to spoof your location when playing games such as Pokémon GO is to be showing yourself traveling from point A to B just as you would in real life. No jumping.

Be sensible, allow for time it would take in real life to travel that distance, and you should go undetected.

## Part 4: Fake GPS Location Spoofer User Reviews

To clarify the credibility of the **Fake GPS Location Spoofer app**, we also took our time to check what other users are saying.

Here, we've summarized some of the top reviews from real users on Playstore.

| **Platform** | **User** | **Remarks** | **Rating** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _The company updates the app, in their own words, fixes the bug, and then expects you to pay again and again and again. Stop support and then maybe a slight tweak of the name with "routes' ' or "joystick" added. I wouldn't mind if the app that was paid for continued to work, but it doesn't. They cut it off. Support is awful. I had to uninstall the app as it wasn't working. Now it wants me to pay again to reinstall. The free version doesn't have import & export or a joystick. Import & export wouldn't be important if reliable._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | Douglas Buell | _This app is okay when it runs like it says it will. Oftentimes it will simply fail in its execution. My main gripe is with the "no ads' ' mode, which requires you to watch a lengthy ad for a 20-minute ad-free period. I would enjoy this feature IF IT WORKED. Anytime I use it, I'm immediately shown an ad the instant I've clicked the message "Congratulations! You unlocked 20 minutes ad-free!" Why include a feature that doesn't work? To force us to watch an ad you didn't have to work for? Ridiculous._ | 1.0/5.0 |
| Google Play Store | A Google User | _Indeed this does work, but it takes a bit of tech effort to make it work, blamed on a glitch in google play services which seems to be exactly true, as they say.
