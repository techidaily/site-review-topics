## Can Life360 Track Or See Text Messages? What Can You Do with Life360 On Apple iPhone 6s Plus?

Life360 is a family locator application that brings people closer to their family members with location sharing and place alerts, but people misunderstand its features and compare it to other spying apps and wonder if **can life360 see text messages**. It is a free application that allows users to track the location of their loved ones with text messages and one-tap directions. However, it cannot see text messages from other messaging apps or other devices.

Life360 uses real-time GPS data to notify your group members about your location as a location-sharing app. It also tracks driving habits and the user's safety while on the road. In addition, you don't have to worry about privacy; people outside your circle can't view or access your location or texts. Here we will answer your various questions about Life360, including, can Life360 see internet history, read or show text, etc. You will also learn how to stop life360 from seeing your location data or texts.

## Part 1: Is Life360 a spy app?

You might have learned from your friends or social media about various applications that allow you to track other devices, view text messages, and track everything someone does on their device. No one, including your circle members, can spy on what you do on your devices, like checking your internet history or reading texts. Although life360 has many tracking features similar to spy apps, it only provides basic location and text tracking under specific conditions. For people who don't use Life360 for privacy reasons, what can life360 monitor? Can Life360 see your internet history, or can Life360 see who you text? Here is a brief about everything the app can do and monitor on your phone.

## Part 2: What can you do with Life360?

Life360 is a mobile application that provides family security services that you can download and use for free on Android and IOS. Its basic features include location and driving safety tracking as the application runs in the background. In addition, the application notifies group members if someone in the group is not driving responsibly. Users can also pay for premium perks to access more safety and tracking features for the security of their loved ones.

There are many valuable features in the life360 app, such as device tracking and locator, which allows you to track your stolen or lost devices. It also allows users to track what other circle members like to do, which route they prefer, and which locations they usually visit. Unfortunately, the app only runs when the location services on any device are turned on, and the user permits it to run in the background. It does not work when the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is turned off, or its battery is dead.

The paid features of life360 notify circle members when you text while driving. Even if the user turns this feature off, it will still show that you are doing something on your phone while driving.

One of the best features of Life360 is the panic button which allows users to send out mass emergency texts to their circle members with their GPS coordinates if they are in danger.

## Part 3: Can Life360 see your texts?

Although it uses some tracking features, there are limitations on what the app can or cannot do. If you are wondering can life360 see your texts, then the answer is "No"; the app can only see and track your texts under one condition. As Life360 links group members' devices, it can read texts sent between members of any group. All circle members get notifications when your app is active. Some applications allow users to view the text on someone's device, like their spouse or partner, but life360 does not compromise the privacy of its users and only shows limited information without any way of spying on others.

Now, you know that Life360 cannot see your text message, but what can Life360 see? Here are some of the typical functionalities and data that Life360 can see:

**1\. Location:** Life360 can track the real-time location of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus devices associated with the app. This includes the ability to view the current whereabouts of family members on a map and track their movements over time.

**2\. Geofencing:** The app allows you to set up geofences, which are virtual boundaries around specific areas. Life360 can detect when a family member enters or leaves a geofenced location and send notifications accordingly.

**3\. Driving behavior:** Life360 offers features to monitor driving behavior, such as detecting speed, hard braking, and rapid acceleration. It can provide insights into how safely someone is driving and notify other family members of any concerning events.

**4\. Crash detection:** Life360 also includes a crash detection feature that uses sensors in the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to detect potential car accidents. In such cases, the app can automatically send alerts to emergency contacts.

**5\. Check-ins and notifications:** You can manually check in at specific locations to let your family members know you have arrived safely. Life360 also allows for sending notifications and messages within the app.

**6\. Battery level:** Life360 may have access to the battery level of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus devices connected to the app. This information can be used to provide alerts when a family member's device is low on battery.

It's important to note that while Life360 is designed to facilitate family communication and safety, the extent of data visibility and tracking can vary based on the settings and permissions configured within the app.

## Part 5: How to stop Life360 from seeing your location data?

Life360 can only have limited access to your texts, but it tracks your location as long as the app runs in the background and the location services are on.

So, all group members can track your location or see your location history all the time. Here is how you can stop life360 from seeing your location.

## Life360 Circle: Everything You Need to Know On Apple iPhone 6s Plus

In order to keep in touch with the persons that matter most to you, you may use circles to create private groups. There are a lot of different situations in which the Circle is useful. Please make sure everything is where it should be. Since Check-Ins, Location Sharing, and Messaging are all exclusive to each Circle, no one who does not need to view a particular piece of information will. You've got the upper hand here. You have complete control over who is and isn't included in your Circle. Privacy is something we take very seriously.

Paying for a Life360 package gives you access to all the Circles. To ensure that everyone in your Circle is able to take advantage of the perks that come with a Life360 Membership, each paid plan for Life360 includes all members in your Circle.

## Part 1: What Is Life360 Circle?

Life360 is a family safety service that offers a variety of services. Its primary focus is to enable families to communicate and stay in touch with each other.

For parents who want to monitor their children from a distance, Life360 is a valuable tool. It is a mapping system that allows your family members to know exactly where you or anybody else in the Family Circle, where Life 360 circle is located at any specified instant, regardless of whether they are in your house or elsewhere.

Since the technology was introduced in 2014, we can safely say that it is no longer considered revolutionary. But, aside from that, some people want to know more than simply where they are, such as how fast they're going when driving.

## Part 2: How Life360 Circle Works?

Life360 has been hailed as an essential tool when it comes to parents and careers. With the help of the Life360 Circle function, the mobile application will track your current position in a ring. Those inside that zone may gain insights about where their kid is heading and track any incoming calls or texts from those who may be concerned about their well-being.

As an added feature, the people concerned may determine whether automatic warnings would appear when someone gets to his location without monitoring him further than only displaying where he paused.

The app will notify you as soon as your beloved person comes or departs from a designated place. You may monitor their speed and position as they drive. In addition, the platform makes it simple to give them instructions by just pressing on their image with life360 circle names.

## Part 3: What Is The Meaning Of Circle Colors In Life360?

Using the app, you may have observed colorful circles/bubbles. In addition, Life360 tells you about different issues depending on the Circle's color. The app's primary colors are purple, orange, and green.

It's important to know what each color symbolizes before establishing its function. For example, what does the green dot on life360 mean? Members with green rings are more visible. The green dot shows whether driver monitoring is turned on. These also show where everyone in the group is and what they've been up to.

The purple Circle shows a Bluetooth-connected gadget. You may check a member's recent location history using purple dots in the app. For example, to open Day Breakdown, click the purple dots.

The orange Circle denotes a criminal complaint. Instead of a recent crime location, this is a warning that a family member may be in a crime hotspot.

## Part 4: What happens when you join a Circle on Life360?

As soon as you've set up your Circle, no one else will be on it. Select "Add a New Member" from the drop-down menu at the bottom of the page, and then forward the recipient a text or email with an invitation key. It will provide instructions to help them acquire the app and join your Circle.

After downloading the app, you'll receive an alert that they have joined your Circle. You'll be able to monitor their activities from then on.
