Indeed, there are different methods you can use to spoof your location to play AR games that require actual movement. While the debate against location spoofing apps is understandable, these software types' also uses effectively improve user experience.

The best step while using them is to follow the gameplay rules respectfully and use a safe and reliable GPS movement simulator like [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) for the task.
