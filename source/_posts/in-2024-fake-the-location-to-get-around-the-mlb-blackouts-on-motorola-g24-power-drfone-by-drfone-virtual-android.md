## Part 3: Why is GPS Spoofing a Problem?

Faking your GPS has its advantages, primarily protecting your privacy.

However, if you're on the receiving end of a fake GPS signal, you need to detect any spoofing attempts before it's too late. You need to have a security measure to ensure data you're receiving is coming from a legitimate source instead of a malicious one. It is especially important for large companies engaging in food delivery, gaming, social media, financial services, etc.

Here are some reasons why your company should be wary of GPS spoofing.

Location spoofing also allows cheaters to use hundreds of mobile devices to collude and share in-game information to scam other players.

**Social Media**

Having a fake GPS on dating apps allows users to unlock more users on their profile to match with in other places. It can be dangerous if scammers or fraudsters use fake GPS to trick people into concealing their actual location.

**Financial Services**

Most financial institutions across the globe use location data to verify users to prevent fraud. Having inaccurate data is a major security beach, especially when handling financial service apps on the internet.

- Using a dedicated GPS simulator and comparing results to expected from provided data.
- Have a security measure to detect GPS spoofing apps installed on a user's smartphone.

While the methods to detect GPS locations are presented above, it's important to remember that detecting fake GPS locations is difficult and requires you to combine different methods.
