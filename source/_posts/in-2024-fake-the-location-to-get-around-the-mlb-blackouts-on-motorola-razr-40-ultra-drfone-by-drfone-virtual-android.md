They can help Chrome track you as long as your device can detect them. If you use cell data, Google Chrome can also track you through cell towers.

The HTML5 Geolocation API is a browser API used to determine a user's geographical location. Developers use it to build location-aware websites and apps that use users' locations as the basis for providing their services. It can detect location through GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IP addresses, etc.

### 3.Why should you hide or spoof your Location?

Hiding or spoofing your location protects your privacy and stop application and websites from tracking you. It also allows you to access geo-restricted apps and play location-based games. You can also fake your location to get the latest updates of your favorite apps.
