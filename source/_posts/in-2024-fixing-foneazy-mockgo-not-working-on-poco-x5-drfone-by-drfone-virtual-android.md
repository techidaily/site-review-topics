If you receive the 1st strike as an iPogo ban, I strongly suggest you never use iPogo again because Niantic will keep a close watch on you. So if your question is, can iPogo get me banned? Then yes, it definitely can.

2. **Be aware of detection methods:** Niantic employs various detection methods to identify players who are using fake GPS tools or engaging in spoofing activities. These methods can include analyzing movement patterns, comparing location data with known landmarks, or detecting inconsistencies in player behavior.

3. **Stay informed:** Keep yourself updated with Pokémon Go's terms of service and any changes or announcements made by Niantic. They may introduce new measures to combat cheating, and being aware of these updates can help you avoid unintentional violations.
