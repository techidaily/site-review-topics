## A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G

Mozilla Firefox is one of the most famous browsers known for its security. Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so **Firefox spoof location** can resolve your concerns.

It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to **fake a location in Firefox** on devices.

![firefox featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox

Before starting with **Firefox location spoof**, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.

### 1\. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API

Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user's location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can't use this API for location determination.

### 2\. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn't have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G device's location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.

## Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers

Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.

### Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox

If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:

**Step 1:** Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the "Three Vertical Bars" icon to select "Settings." Now, tap "Privacy & Security" from the left sidebar and navigate to "Permissions."

![access privacy and security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click "Settings" in front of "Location" to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between "Remove Web Site" or "Remove All Web Sites" to remove their location access.

![remove the specific or all websites](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** If you want to block the websites from accessing your location indefinitely, you can select the "Block new requests asking to access your location" option. Once selected, click "Save Changes" to disable your geolocation on Firefox.

![enable the block new option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg)

### Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location

Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That's why it is better to **spoof the location on Firefox** rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:

**Step 1:** Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type "about:config" and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the "Accept the Risk and Continue" button to proceed further.

![hit the accept the risk button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** First search for "Geo.enabled," and when it appears, toggle its value from "True" to "False" to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for "geo.provider.network.url" and press the "Pen" icon to edit it.

![tap on the edit button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:

**"data:application/json,{"location": {"lat": LATITUDE VALUE, "lng": LONGITUDE VALUE}, "accuracy": 27000.0}."**

Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.

![add your fake firefox location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-7.jpg)

### Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension

Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the "[Location Guard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/)" add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add "Location Guard" and use it to alter your location are following:

**Step 1:** Click on the "Three Vertical Bars" icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select "Add-ons and themes." Tap "Extensions" from the left sidebar and search for "Location Guard" in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click "Add to Firefox" to add it to your browser.

![add the extension to firefox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can choose between two options to protect your location's privacy. Using the "Privacy Levels" option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.

![set the privacy levels](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg)

**Step 3:** Using its "Fixed Location" feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the "Marker" on it to change your browser's location.
