## Can Life360 Track You When Your Realme GT Neo 5 is off?

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Did you know that your Realme GT Neo 5 tracks your location even when turned off? And if you're a member of any social media network, it means you could be tracked. Do you like to have your privacy? Do you want to protect your kids from being tracked by strangers?

Of course Yes! Well, then you should know that Your Realme GT Neo 5 can track your movements even when switched off. But is that true?

In the event that you switch off your Realme GT Neo 5, the GPS function will also be disabled. As a result, it will not be able to determine your position when your Realme GT Neo 5 is turned off. However, Life360 will continue to provide the most recent location data that was uploaded to your account.

Should we trust Life360, the social media company that recently merged with Google, to protect our privacy? Let's take a look at the facts.

- [Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part1)
- [Part 2: Does life360 work if the phone is off?](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part2)
- [Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You![hot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/hot-tip.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off.html#Part3)

## Part 1: What Is Life360 And How Does It Work?

The one app that kids hate and parents adore is called Life360. Life360 is monitoring software that can be downloaded into your Realme GT Neo 5 and used by the individuals who are part of your Family Circle to monitor your location and the location of anybody else who is part of your Family Circle.

The app works by sending a request to your cellular carrier to get your location and then sending that information to the Life360 servers. In addition, life360 will store your location and send it to your social networks automatically.

Life360 is not required to track your location, but it is required to send your location to your social networks.

If you want to know more about Life360, check out our Life360 Review.

When it comes to privacy, many people are becoming more aware of how it is being violated. As a result, there's no need to worry about whether or not the monitoring app in concern is as trustworthy as Life360.

Disconnecting from Life360 is as simple as turning off your Realme GT Neo 5 and preventing the app from following and reporting your every step. Unfortunately, it also means that no one can see where they are about one another or how long it has been since they last updated their position.

If the necessity ever arose, such an undertaking may be useful for maintaining one's privacy. However, customers have no idea that Life 360 may still be used to monitor them by other people.

Premium users will still have access to the last 30 days' worth of location data, so the other person will be able to see where you were last seen.

## Part 3: 3 Ways to Stop Life360 from Tracking You

### 1\. Low Data Consumption

Disabling Life360's Wi-Fi and Data may result in a warning to parents that their children are offline so that they can keep an eye on their kids. Does life 360 drain the battery? Low data mode is a better option for turning off life360 without alerting your parents. Go to the Settings and locate Life360; however, do not deactivate the exact location.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

Alternatively, you should disable background app refresh, mobile network, physical activity, and WIFI to save battery life. An issue with your Internet connection will come up instead of location stopped in this situation. So don't connect to any Wi-Fi at all.

### 2\. Fake Locations

Using location spoofing applications on an Android smartphone, your kids can fool you into thinking they're somewhere else. [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is a location spoofing application that will trick you into thinking that you are in a different location than you really are. The GPS position of the Realme GT Neo 5 device will be updated to reflect the new place that you have chosen thanks to the software. It is worth noting that Dr. Fone - Virtual Location for iOS may also enable you to imitate GPS movement.

It has several other noticeable features that can help you in your daily life.

### 3\. Setting Wi-Fi and Data Services to "Off."

Another typical method kids use to prevent their parents from monitoring their position is to disable Life360's Wi-Fi and Data. It works like this. If you don't want applications updating in the background, enable power-saving mode.

Use a wired connection. Adolescents can turn off Wi-Fi and data when using the Life360 app on an iPhone. Go to Settings, look for Life360, and disable Cellular Data, Background Refresh, and Motion & Fitness. You'll be able to keep track of where you are on Life360.

![low data consumption](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/can-life360-track-you-when-your-phone-is-off-02.jpg)

All these methods can be used to Stop Life360 from Tracking You. However, the best all-in-one solution is a third-party application called Dr.Fone. This Virtual Location Software helps you keep your tracking off, but you can also fake your location very easily in minutes.

### Conclusion

Can you track a phone if the location is off? Life360 has become a standard feature of many smartphones. Parents often use it to monitor their children's location. The fact that Life360 can be used to track users is quite disturbing. The good news is that there are ways to stop Life360 from tracking you.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

### Part 1: Simulate Movement Along a Route (One-Stop Route)

The function is represented by the third icon from the left in the section. While you have already teleported to another location or are using your current location, you can tap anywhere on the map to set your destination location.

![activate one stop route mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Step 2Define Simulation Parameters

Enter a number to define how many times you want to go back and forth, and select whether you want a **Round trip** or a **Loop trip**. Drag the slider on the speed option to set how fast you want to walk. Proceed to click **Move Here** on the bottom to start the movement simulation.

![set parameters to simulate](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

![start one stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

### Part 2: Simulate Movement Along a Route (Multi-Stop Route)

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_I4YgjYno" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

You can try the multi-stop mode if you want to pass by multiple places along a route on the map. Learn how it is done when you are trying to **spoof location on Android/**iOS:

Step 1Start Multi-Stop Route and Set Parameters

Activate the **Multi-Stop Route** mode from the top-right section next to the One-Stop Route mode. After activating the mode, set multiple spots on the map by clicking your required place. Define the number of trips and speed. Click **Start Moving** to initiate the process.

**Note:** Select the spots along a specific road to prevent the game developer from thinking you are cheating.

![activate multi stop simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Step 2View Multi-Stop Route Movement

As the simulation starts, click **Pause** at any instance where you want to stop the simulation. You can also **Clear** all settings if required.

![execute multi stop route simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

### Part 3: Use Joystick for More Flexible GPS Control (Joystick Movement)

Dr.Fone has integrated the joystick feature into the Virtual Location program to spare 90% of the labor for GPS control. You can always find the joystick on the lower left part in teleport mode. And you can also click the joystick button in the upper right (the 5th one) to use the joystick feature.

![try joystick movement for simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png)

The joystick, like one-stop route or multi-stop route modes, aims to facilitate GPS movement on the map. But what's better? The joystick lets you move on the map by changing directions in real time. Here are the two main scenes where you will definitely love the joystick.

- **Automatic GPS movement:** Click the Start button in the middle, and the automatic movement starts. Then just change the directions as you like by 1) clicking the left or right arrows, 2) dragging the spot around the circle, 3) pressing keys A and D on the keyboard, or 4) pressing keys Left and Right on the keyboard.
- **Manual GPS movement:** Move forward by constantly clicking the Up arrow in the program and long-pressing the key W or Up on the keyboard. Reverse by constantly clicking the Down arrow, or long-pressing the key S or Down on the keyboard. You can also tweak the directions using the four ways above before moving forward or reverse.
