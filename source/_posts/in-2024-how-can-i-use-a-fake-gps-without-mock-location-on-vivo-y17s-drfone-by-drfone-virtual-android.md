## Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Vivo Y17s

Due to this, the PPTP VPN is widely used to bypass location-based restrictions.

- The free VPN PPTP supplies data into packets and send them through a tunnel to attain a secure communication.
- Data is encrypted and its authenticity is kept intact. Due to this, the free PPTP VPN is extensively used in public networks as well.
- It supports the 128-bit Point to Point encryption.
- It is quite easy to setup PPTP free VPN (only the server address, username, and password are needed).
- Even though PPTP is secure and pretty fast, it is not as safe as other protocols (that support 256-bit encryption). It is believed that the government is now able to crack it.
