### 1\. Lost Messages

Sometimes you might accidentally or intentionally delete WhatsApp chats or messages. Fortunately, Dr.Fone can help you dig out and recover those messages with a simple click. Just launch the [Data Recovery tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/whatsapp-transfer/), connect your phone to the software, and Dr.Fone will scan for all lost and current messages.

### 2\. Transfer WhatsApp data

Thanks to the fast-paced mobile technology, it's inevitable to migrate to a new phone. But you'll have to sacrifice all your WhatsApp data. Luckily, Dr.Fone allows you to [backup, restore, and transfer all WhatsApp data](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/whatsapp-transfer/).

### 3\. Backup WhatsApp Business chats

Having a WhatsApp Business account is vital if you're an online marketer. Here, you can create a business profile and enjoy quick replies, automatic messaging, accurate statistics, and so on. So, to avoid losing your invoices and other business chats, use Dr.Fone to back up and transfer your WhatsApp Business chats to a new phone.

### Final Words

See, there's nothing complex about the WhatsApp live location not updating issue. Just edit and restart the app or check your location settings if it's enabled. And, of course, use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to share a fake location on WhatsApp and perform other WhatsApp tasks like backing up and transferring data. Thank me later!
