## A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On Oppo A2

Mozilla Firefox is one of the most famous browsers known for its security. Like other browsers, it also tracks your location and shares it with websites. Although Firefox asks for your permission before sharing your location, it can still be a privacy concern for many people. For many reasons, disabling your location is disadvantageous, so **Firefox spoof location** can resolve your concerns.

It is not hard to change or spoof your location in Mozilla Firefox. Stick with this article to learn different ways to **fake a location in Firefox** on devices.

![firefox featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Preparations Before Spoofing Your Location in Firefox

Before starting with **Firefox location spoof**, you must be aware of how the platform and websites determine your location. There are many ways a browser can detect your location. It includes services like IP addresses, GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The main tool browsers and websites use to determine your location is HTML5 Geolocation API.

### 1\. Basic Understanding of the HTML5 Geolocation API

Basically, a browser API called HTML5 Geolocation API is used by websites and browsers to detect a user's location using longitude and latitude coordinates. It is strictly based on user permissions for detecting location. That means you will receive a permission prompt whenever a website or browser uses it to detect your location. If you refuse the permission, they can't use this API for location determination.

### 2\. How Does HTML5 Geolocation Work?

HTML5 Geolocation determines your location using the longitude and latitude coordinates with the help of GPS. If your device doesn't have GPS tracking, it uses Wi-Fi and cell tower signals to detect the Oppo A2 device's location. The location detected by HTML5 Geolocation is highly accurate with accuracy up to street level. Due to its high precision in locating users, it can create privacy issues for users.

## Part 2: How to Fake Your Location in Mozilla Firefox on Computers

Many ways are available for you to fake or disable your desktop location in Mozilla Firefox to address your privacy concerns. You can either disable or change the location in the browser or use a third-party app or extension. Below, we have explained the three most common ways to fake or disable your location in Firefox.

### Method 1: Disable Geolocation in Firefox

If you want to stop websites from accessing your location from Mozilla Firefox, you can disable the geolocation feature using Firefox Settings. The process to disable your location in Mozilla Firefox is covered using these steps:

**Step 1:** Open Mozilla Firefox on your computer to disable its location. Click the "Three Vertical Bars" icon to select "Settings." Now, tap "Privacy & Security" from the left sidebar and navigate to "Permissions."

![access privacy and security](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click "Settings" in front of "Location" to manage the location settings. It will open a window with a list of all the websites that can access your location. Depending on your needs, you can choose between "Remove Web Site" or "Remove All Web Sites" to remove their location access.

![remove the specific or all websites](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-3.jpg)

![enable the block new option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-4.jpg)

### Method 2: Manually Change Your Firefox Location

Disabling your location on Mozilla Firefox can stop websites from accessing your location. It also means websites with location-based services will no longer work. That's why it is better to **spoof the location on Firefox** rather than disabling it. Firefox allows you to manually change your location using its advanced settings. The steps required for this process are given below:

**Step 1:** Once Mozilla Firefox is open, type "about:config" and press Enter. You will see a warning screen as you modify advanced settings. You have to click on the "Accept the Risk and Continue" button to proceed further.

![hit the accept the risk button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** First search for "Geo.enabled," and when it appears, toggle its value from "True" to "False" to disable geolocation. To spoof your location, search for "geo.provider.network.url" and press the "Pen" icon to edit it.

![tap on the edit button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can enter your desired location using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The format to enter your location coordinates should be:

**"data:application/json,{"location": {"lat": LATITUDE VALUE, "lng": LONGITUDE VALUE}, "accuracy": 27000.0}."**

Once done, your geolocation will be changed to your desired location.

### Method 3: Use The Location Guard Firefox Extension

Another way you can protect your location from websites is to use the "[Location Guard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/location-guard/)" add-on in Mozilla Firefox. It is generally recognized as an extension, also available in the Add-Ons Store of Firefox. The steps to add "Location Guard" and use it to alter your location are following:

**Step 1:** Click on the "Three Vertical Bars" icon from the top left corner of your Firefox and select "Add-ons and themes." Tap "Extensions" from the left sidebar and search for "Location Guard" in the Add-Ons Store. Once located, click "Add to Firefox" to add it to your browser.

![add the extension to firefox](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-8.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can choose between two options to protect your location's privacy. Using the "Privacy Levels" option, you can select a privacy level and location range to add noise when a website tries to locate you. It stops websites from detecting your accurate location, though they can still locate the general area.

![set the privacy levels](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-9.jpg)

**Step 3:** Using its "Fixed Location" feature from the left sidebar, you can change your location. Here, select any location from the map by placing the "Marker" on it to change your browser's location.

![set the fixed location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-fake-your-location-in-firefox-browser-10.jpg)

But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.

## **Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify**

But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.

**Region specific Content**

![spotify region specific content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg)

Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.

**Playlists and Recommendations**

![spotify region geography playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg)

Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.

So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.

**Payment Plans**

![potify payment plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg)

The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.

**Spotify Unavailable**

![spotify unavailable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg)

Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.

## **Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?**

You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -

**Step 1:** Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.

![spotify log in page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.

**Step 3:** Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.

![new location on spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg)

If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.

**Step 4 (Premium):** In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.

## **Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.

Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.

**Step 1:** Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.
