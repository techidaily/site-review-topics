For Hulu errors 3 and 5 that are regarding connection issues, you can try to restart the streaming device and also restart your router. For error 16 that shows invalid region issues, you need to use a VPN that can help you bypass the region blocks of Hulu. Some of the other possible ways to fix different code error issues include reinstalling or updating the Hulu app, checking the internet connection, removing the Realme Note 50 device from the account, and adding it again.

### Q3. How to fix the Hulu Home Location Errors?

Hulu allows watching live TV on the local US channels including CBS, and others. The channels that you will be allowed to watch will be determined by the IP address and the GPS location that was detected at the time of first sign-up and this is called the – **Hulu home location**. The home location will apply to all the Realme Note 50 devices that will be associated with the Hulu + Live TV account.

Even while traveling the home location content will be visible but if you stay away from your home location for a period of 30 days, an error will appear. In a year, you can change the home location for4 times, and for this GPS will be used with the IP address.

So, even if you change your IP address using a VPN, you cannot change the GPS location and an error will appear.

To bypass these errors, there are 2 ways by which may help you **remove home location errors**:

**Method 1. Install a VPN on your home router**

Before you sign-up for a Hulu account, you can set up a VPN on your router and set a location as desired. Also, use a streaming device like Roku, and others that do not require GPS for watching the Hulu content. While using this method, ensure not to change your VPN server frequently else it will alert Hulu.

**Method 2. Get a VPN with a GPS spoofer**

Another way is by spoofing the GPS location and for this, you can use Surfshark’s GPS spoofer on its Android app that is named “GPS override”. This app will help you to align the GPS location as per the selected VPN server. First, use the app to change the IP address and the GPS, and then the Home Location can be updated in the settings so that it can match with the proxy location.

### Final Words

To watch Hulu outside the US, use a premium VPN service provider that can set a proxy location for your device. For spoofing GPS on your mobile devices,Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, works as an excellent tool.
