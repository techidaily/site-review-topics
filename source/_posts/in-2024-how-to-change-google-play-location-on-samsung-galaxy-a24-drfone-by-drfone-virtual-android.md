## Part 3: The Most Effective Way to Fake Location on iOS and Android

This tool works in every situation and allows users to travel the globe through their phones free of cost. You can also travel with an exact GPS location just with a single click.

## How to Share Location in Messenger On Samsung Galaxy A24?

We usually host a gathering once in a while and invite our friends to come over. Most of us are already used to organizing such activities because we’ve been doing that for a long time now. However, we cannot deny that it’s much easier nowadays than years ago. Why so? Simply because the communication channels available today at our disposal are more digital and more capable. For instance, Facebook Messenger now allows users to share their whereabouts in a snap of a finger. Yes. That feature is called Live Location.

The Live Location feature on Messenger works beyond sending the address or coordinates of your exact location. It basically visualizes your whereabouts by means of an interactive map and updates the details from time to time. That means the receiver can view not only your position but also your movements. Is that helpful? Absolutely yes. It’s indeed a game-changer in today’s already convenient world. Is it highly recommended? With proper handling and adequate caution, Messenger’s Live Location can definitely do more good than harm to the users.

In this article, we will delve into the highlights and benefits of Facebook Messenger’s location-sharing features. We will also provide some tutorials on **how to share Live Location** on Messenger. Continue reading below to learn more.



## Part 1. Everything You Should Know About Messenger’s Live Location

Facebook is well aware that sharing location details is essential to its users. That’s why developers have come up with a brilliant idea and rolled out Live Location on Messenger.

Just make sure that the location services on your smartphone are activated so you can view your progress in real time. Also, stay vigilant while you’re out and keep yourself safe from any harm.

## 8 Solutions to Fix 'Find My Friends Location Not Available' On Samsung Galaxy A24

There is no doubt that Find My Friends is an excellent application for location tracking. It allows users to track the location of their friends and family members through a variety of devices. So, when Find My Friends says the location is not available, it can be a frustrating situation. But don't stress over this because we are here to assist you in Find My Friends not working.

![find my friends location not available](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/find-my-friends-location-not-available.jpg)

## Part 1: What Does "Location Not Available" Mean on Find My Friends?

When the "Location Not Available" message appears on Find My Friends, it means that you have disabled location sharing or have turned off your device's location services. This message can also appear if your device is in an area with poor network coverage or if your device is turned off. In some cases, the message can indicate that you have logged out of your iCloud account or that there is an issue with the iCloud server.

**_Does "Location Not Available" mean that there is something wrong with Samsung Galaxy A24 ?_**

Not! This message does not necessarily mean that you have blocked yourself or there is something wrong with your device. If you frequently see the "Location Not Available" message, you may need to check your own device's settings or contact your friends to confirm their location-sharing preferences.

[**_How to distinguish "No Location Found" and "Location Not Available"?_**](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/no-location-found-vs-location-not-available.html)

"No Location Found" means that the Find My app is unable to locate the Samsung Galaxy A24 device being tracked. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if the Samsung Galaxy A24 device is turned off, not connected to the internet, or if location services are disabled.

"Location Not Available" means that the Samsung Galaxy A24 device is not currently sharing its location with the Find My app. This can happen if the Samsung Galaxy A24 device is in Airplane mode or if the user has turned off location sharing for the Find My app. It can also happen if there is a temporary issue with the iCloud servers.

In summary, "No Location Found" means the app could not locate the Samsung Galaxy A24 device, while "Location Not Available" means that the Samsung Galaxy A24 device is not currently sharing its location.

## Part 2: Possible Reasons For Find My Friends Location Samsung Galaxy A24  Not Available

Why does Find My Friends say location not available? Before we get to the solutions, let's explore the possible reasons behind this problem. It is apparent that when the location is not found on Find My Friends, there is an underlying problem. Here are the possible reasons that could cause this error:

- Your friend's device has an inaccurate date
- The other device isn't connected to a network, or it's off
- Hide My Location feature is active on your friend's phone
- The Location Services are also turned off on the friend's device
- Your friend hasn't signed in to the service
- The location of your friend is in a country or region where Apple doesn't provide this feature

All these reasons can be the ones causing trouble on your Samsung Galaxy A24  and Android phones. Hence, you will have to look for some conventional methods to fix the unavailable location error.

## Part 3: 8 Tips To Make "Find My Friends Location" Available

When the Find My Friends app location is not available, here are some more tips that can help get rid of this issue.

### Tip 1: Check if Find My Friends is Supported in Region/Country

The foremost thing you should do when the Find My Friends location is not available is to check the region/country's location. Apple Inc still hasn't provided the Find My Friends feature in all countries and regions due to local laws and technical issues. So, the most plausible reason for the app not working properly is solely because it is not available in that particular country/region.

### Tip 2: Quit and enable GPS or Location Services again

After verifying that the feature is available in your region, enable the GPS & Location Services. In case you've already enabled the feature, turn it off, quit the app, and again enable the service. It might fix the location not found on the Find My Friends issue you've been facing. Just open Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services and toggle the bar to turn the feature on or off.

![enable location services](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/enable-location-services.jpg)

### Tip 3: Adjust Samsung Galaxy A24  Date and Time

As we stated in the possible reasons, incorrect dates and times also result in this problem. If you have manually set the date and time, change the settings and set it to "Set Automatically" in General Settings. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem when the Find My Friends location is not available.

![adjust date and time](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/adjust-date-and-time.jpg)

### Tip 4: Check the Internet

Before you conclude that there is something wrong with the Find My Friends app, check your internet connection. There is a chance that location is not available on the Samsung Galaxy A24  because your device doesn't have internet access. Try opening Settings > Mobile Data/Wi-Fi and turning it on and off. Alongside, make sure that you have signal strength, whether you are connecting to cellular data or a Wi-Fi network.

![check internet connection](https://www.virtuallocation.com/images/pokemon-go/check-internet-connection.jpg)
