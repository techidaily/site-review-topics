The iPhone Location settings are useful for providing optimum and smooth services to iPhone users. Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn't. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.

The in-built apps like 'Camera' use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.

![photo with date stamp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg)

Your 'Reminder or Alarm' apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you've reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.

![reminder app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg)

The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.

Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it's okay to share the Location. If you accept, that's how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS.

Install and run Dr.Fone on your Mac or Windows PC and then connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable. After that, select the file transfer option on your phone and then tap **Virtual Location** on Dr.Fone.

**Step 2. Connect your phone to the software.**

![connect phone with virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png)

You'll see a new Dr.Fone window, where you'll click the **Get Started** button. Then, enable USB debugging on your phone before clicking **Next.**

**Step 3. Choose a location and start moving.**

![search a location on virtual location and go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

The Virtual Location map will launch after successfully connecting your smartphone to Dr.Fone. Now enter and select a location you wish to move to and click **Move Here**. Alternatively,  you can tap an area to move to on the map and choose whether to move by foot, bicycle, scooter, or car. Your iPhone and Android device will save your new location automatically.

## Wrap it up

See, you don't need an expensive VPN service to fake your GPS location on Facebook convincingly. With Dr.Fone, you can easily change your Honor V Purse or iPhone location, which will immediately reflect on apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Telegram, and so on. And guess what? There are a host of other phone management features to exploit. You should try it!
