## How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Apple iPhone 7 Plus

Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts.

Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.

![spotify music app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg)

But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.

## **Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify**

But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.

**Region specific Content**

![spotify region specific content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg)

Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.

**Playlists and Recommendations**

![spotify region geography playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg)

Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.

So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.

**Payment Plans**

![potify payment plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg)

The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.

**Spotify Unavailable**

![spotify unavailable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg)

Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.

## **Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?**

You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -

**Step 1:** Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.

![spotify log in page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.

![spotify acct overview](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.

![new location on spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg)

If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.

**Step 4 (Premium):** In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.

![premium-account-change-plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg)

## **Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?**

Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.

**Step 1:** You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare[Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Step 2:** Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.

![ dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5:** Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The New Location will now display on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus/Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.



## **Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.

Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.

**Step 1:** Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.

![nordvpn app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg)

**Step 2:** Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.

![connect to server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg)

The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server

![change server using spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg)

**Step 3:** In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.

![choose countries to change ](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg)

The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.

### Conclusion

## Life360: Learn How Everything Works On Apple iPhone 7 Plus

Nothing is more important than your mobile device when it comes to your security, privacy, and family. Thanks to its easy-to-use features and excellent app, with Life360, your life will be as secure and private as possible.

Whether you're looking to sync photos, videos, contacts, messages, and locations with your mobile devices and computers or simply set up your home cameras to automatically send you alerts, Life360 is designed to be the most powerful mobile phone service provider you've ever seen.

It's the most secure and easiest-to-use service, but it's not the cheapest. So, let's know what Life360 is and how Life360 work.

## Part 1: What Is Life360?

A smartphone software called Life360 tracking system enables families to communicate, track their whereabouts, and get alerts about their loved one's safety and well-being.

When Life360 is installed on the phone, the administrator may create geo-fences specifying certain locations. For example, geo-fences might be employed to monitor family members' arrival and departure times. In addition to that, the program provides driving analysis by means of the Life360 Driver Protect module.

Additionally, BMW has incorporated Life360 into its onboard location tracking. Accident identification and rescue operations are provided through an app that tracks authorized drivers and offers monitoring and analysis.

Both parties need to have the app installed for one to be able to monitor the activities of the other. Using the app, you can see where your phone is at any given moment. A member of your family might know exactly where you are at any given time if they have the app on their phone.

Whether you are currently using the app or not, the Life360 app tracker will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of your mobile device. In addition, you may obtain real-time location information on each other, view it on a hidden map, and even choose to get automatic notifications anytime someone enters or departs a spot, according to the Life 360 website.

Every time a family member departs or comes someplace, an alert is sent to the rest of the family. You can share your location with an adult, and they can see how fast you were driving, how long it took you to come home, and who was home or at school while you were gone.

In addition, adults and children may obtain real-time instructions from a particular family member. For example, you may touch an icon of a family member to receive instructions to that user's location on the Life360 website.

## Part 3: Is Life360 Always Accurate?

Previously, Life360 was criticized for being inaccurate, especially when locating people. However, the company has recently updated its system to ensure that the data it collects is accurate.

The Life360 app uses GPS technology to track your location. When you first install the app, you will be prompted to set up your location. This is done by entering your zip code, city, and state.

You will also be asked to select a default location. This will be used to determine your home address. Once you enter your zip code, city, and state, you will be able to view your location on a map.

Also, Life360 works best in urban areas. If you live in an area with many tall buildings, Life360 may not work as well.

## Part 4: Is Life360 Safe for Your Privacy?

Life360 is a relatively new app, but it has been getting attention lately. People are wondering whether it is safe for them to use and whether or not it is worth it.

According to the Life360 website, the app is safe because it is encrypted. The encryption ensures that no one can intercept your communications.

If you are worried about privacy, you can disable the app's location tracking feature. You can also disable the feature if you want to be notified whenever someone enters or leaves a particular area.

You can also use the app without giving anyone else access to your location. You can create a guest profile.

There are no ads or in-app purchases. You do not have to give any information to Life360. You can use the app without giving any information.

Life360 is also very easy to use. You do not need to have any special training to use the app. You simply need to sign up and download the app.

Life360 is available for free on Google Play and Apple App Store.

## Part 5: Can a Location be faked on Life360?

What if You do not want your location to be tracked by someone else? One of the main reasons why people use Life360 is that it allows you to share your location with friends, family, and even strangers. However, if you do not want to be tracked by others, you need to know how to fake your location.

Unfortunately, you cannot spoof your location through Life360, so it is evident that you have to use another way to ensure that no one will know where you are. The easiest solution is an application called [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) which can help you change your location in real-time.
