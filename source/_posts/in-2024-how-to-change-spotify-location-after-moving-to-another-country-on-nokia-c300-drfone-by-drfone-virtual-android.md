## How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Nokia C300

Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.

![spotify music app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg)

But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.

## **Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify**

But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.

**Region specific Content**

![spotify region specific content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg)

Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.

**Playlists and Recommendations**

![spotify region geography playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg)

Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.

So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.

**Payment Plans**

![potify payment plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg)

The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.

**Spotify Unavailable**

![spotify unavailable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg)

Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.

## **Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?**

You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -

**Step 1:** Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.

![spotify log in page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.

![spotify acct overview](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.

![new location on spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg)

If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.

**Step 4 (Premium):** In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.

![premium-account-change-plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg)

## **Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?**

Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.

**Step 1:** You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare[Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Step 2:** Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.

![dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Nokia C300 to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5:** Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The New Location will now display on your iPhone/Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.



## **Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.

Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.

**Step 1:** Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.

![nordvpn app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg)

**Step 2:** Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.

![connect to server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg)

The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server

![change server using spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg)

**Step 3:** In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.

![choose countries to change](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg)

The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.

### Conclusion

## What are Location Permissions Life360 On Nokia C300?

Sometimes you need to decide whether you can share certain personal information or data about yourself with others, which may involve location permissions.

Location permissions Life360 allows you to share the location of your device with other apps, even if those apps aren't in your app library. It's usually a good idea to use location permissions sparingly, but sometimes you'll need to use them.

Life360 uses location permissions for a few different reasons. For example, Life360 uses location permissions to show nearby friends when they check in to places so that you can see who is nearby and what they're up to.

## Part 1：What Does "Location Permissions Off" Mean on Life360?

There are two ways to prevent GPS tracking on the phone: switch off the phone's GPS or take off Life360 rights to track your whereabouts using GPS.

It's possible that Life360 won't work properly if you don't accept the permissions it requests during the installation process. When it comes to authorizing access to Life360, you have the following choices available to you:

If you choose the 'never option', the application will not be granted the required rights. As a result, the software may fail to perform as it is meant to. Whether you're unclear if you want to offer the program complete access or not, this is the ideal 'Ask any time' decision to bring.

Your location may be granted every time the app is used if you wish. 'While the App' setting permits accessibility to Location Services only when the app itself or one of its functionalities is currently displayed on the screen.

Your device's status bar may glow blue and display a message notifying you that an application is currently using your location data if the While Using the App setting is enabled for one of your apps.

"Always" grants the software all the permissions it needs. So, for example, allowing location permission will be done – every time the app launches. As a result, the software can track your location even if the application is closed.

## Part 2：Can My Nokia C300 Be Tracked If Location Services Are Off?

If you misplace your phone or want to run an application that requires to access your location, you may use the already developed location settings on your smartphone. Suppose, on the other hand; you don't want anybody to track your phone?

Is it possible to track a phone even if the location services are disabled? Mobile phones can be tracked even when location services are off, and the answer to that question is, "Yes."

Disabling your phone's location services might help you hide your current whereabouts. This is critical if you don't want others to be able to follow your movements or activities. However, other methods may still find a smartphone's overall geolocation using different ways.

### 1\. Cell-Site Simulators

A cell-site simulator is a device that can imitate a mobile phone tower and force a nearby mobile phone to connect to it. Cell site simulators can be purchased online or at a local electronics store. Law enforcement agencies use them to locate a phone without a warrant.

### 2\. Malware or Spyware

Malware and spyware can use various techniques to track your phone's location. For example, a malware program may be able to detect your location based on Your Nokia C300's hardware.

Some mobile malware or spyware can detect and track your location without the need for the user's consent.

### 3\. Cell Towers

Cell towers can provide a rough estimate of a phone's location. A cell tower is a network access point that connects a mobile phone to the Internet. A smartphone's location can be found by triangulating the position of cell towers near your device. This method works best when the cell towers are close together.

### 4\. Wi-Fi Snooping

When a Wi-Fi hotspot is nearby, your phone can connect to it without needing to connect to a cell tower. Your phone can then transmit the signal back to the hotspot, which will record the Nokia C300 device's IP address.

## Part 3：How Do I Pause Life360 without My Parents Knowing?

There are many ways to ensure your parents do not know where you are and what you are doing. Some of these methods are:

### 1\. Switch to the Airplane Mode

Turning on Airplane Mode on your smartphone is another fast approach to preventing Life360 from broadcasting your whereabouts without your parents being aware. Unfortunately, you'll be unable to use your phone's internet connection after setting off Airplane Mode, so you'll lose your GPS position.

![switch to the airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/06/what-are-location-permissions-life360-1.jpg)
