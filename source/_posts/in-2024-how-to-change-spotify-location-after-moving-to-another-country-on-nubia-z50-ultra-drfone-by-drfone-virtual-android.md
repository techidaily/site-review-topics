## How to Change Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country On Nubia Z50 Ultra

Spotify is one of the best apps to access quality music and podcasts. Be it in your car while you commute from the workplace to home or simply when you are home with your latte, the music is made for every mood. Spotify is easy to use, you can make your own playlist and you have access to a lot of musical content.

![spotify music app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-direct-music-app-pic1.jpg)

But this depends on the country you are staying in. And if you’ve recently shifted your base, it can be tricky to change spotify region. But if you opt for the manual methods, it is a breeze to update location spotify. We will teach you how that is done effectively using different resources available to you.

## **Part 1: Reasons for changing Location on Spotify**

But why to Change Location Spotify in the first place? Is it important to change your location if you are changing countries? Will that affect the music on the streaming app? Yes! It certainly will. Before we discuss the different ways to change country on spotify, let us understand why we should do it at all.

**Region specific Content**

![spotify region specific content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/region-specific-content-pic2.jpg)

Everything is not available everywhere. If you are looking for a specific motivational podcast that is a hit in the US, it might not be available in your region. You like that new Arabic song, maybe it won’t stream in your Australian lanes. The content can be restricted to a specific region and if you don’t stay there, it is far away from your reach. You have to rely on Spotify Change Location to access that musical content.

**Playlists and Recommendations**

![spotify region geography playlists](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-region-geography-playlists-pic3.jpg)

Spotify uses your coordinates to provide the right music content for you. There are people who jump up and down and say that the app suggests songs that are their absolute favorite! As if it has read their minds. This is possible because Spotify identifies the most played songs in the region, detects the language and delivers these suggestions to you.

So, the content that you receive depends on the place that you are staying in.

**Payment Plans**

![potify payment plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-payment-plan-pic4.jpg)

The Spotify premium account provides more benefits than the normal free version that people use. But what many of us are not aware of is that the premium version’s cost differs from place to place. If you can manage a spotify location update, you can save yourself some bucks.

**Spotify Unavailable**

![spotify unavailable](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-unavailable-pic5.jpg)

Spotify did gain a lot of popularity in a very short period of time. People are making money, uploading their own content and even exploring newer genres of music. However, Spotify is not available world-wide. Currently, it is only accessible from 65 countries. If you hail from a region where Spotify hasn’t launched yet, you need to update spotify location to a place where it is fully functional.

## **Part 2: How To Edit Your Country on Spotify?**

You can change region spotify manually by directly tweaking a few settings in the Account Overview section. If you are using a Free Spotify account, then you will have to manually change your location. But a person who has a Premium Spotify account can access all the content from all those countries where spotify is legally available. Here’s how you can change the location using the Spotify settings -

**Step 1:** Go to the Spotify Homepage on your desktop and Log into your account. This is how you do it if you happen to have a free account. Premium accounts don’t need it. After you Log in, go to the ‘Accounts’ section.

![spotify log in page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/spotify-log-in-page-pic6.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the sidebar, go to the ‘Account Overview’ option. When you click on it, you will find the ‘Edit Profile’ option on the screen. Go for it.

![spotify acct overview](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/account-overview-spotify-pic7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you click on theEdit Profile option, there will be several categories that display your personal information. If you scroll down, you will find the ‘Country’ Option. Select the country of your choice there.

![new location on spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/new-location-on-spotify-pic8.jpg)

If you are a Spotify Free user, then you will have to go by the above mentioned method. But if you are a Spotify premium user, you don’t need to change location to access content. However, you can change it to update the Payment plans.

**Step 4 (Premium):** In the same Account Overview option, you can either ‘Update’ your new location and spotify works accordingly. Otherwise, you can completely Change your Plan as well.

![premium-account-change-plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/premium-account-change-plan-pic9.jpg)

## **Part 3: How to Use Apps to Fake Spotify Location?**

Now you know that by Spotify Change Country, you can get more benefits and you can enjoy podcasts, music and other audio content that is otherwise unavailable in your region. So, it is understandable that you’d want to deliberately fake spotify location. This is possible when you use some of the best Location Spoofer softwares available on the internet. Our best suggestion would be Wondershare’s Dr.Fone. It is easy to use and your location will be changed within a few minutes in minimal steps.

**Step 1:** You need to download the executive file of the Wondershare[Dr. Fone’s Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)Spoofer. The android and even Windows compatible files are available on the website. Choose appropriately and download - and launch them.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2GiOQxwfQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Step 2:** Once you launch the application, the homepage will open and several options will display on the screen. Choose the Virtual Location option that is usually at the end of the page.

![dr.fone home screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 3:** To Change Location on Spotify Mobile, connect your Nubia Z50 Ultra to your computer - both Android and iPhones can detect the virtual location change. Then click on Get Started.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4:** A map will appear on the screen. You can change the pi to a new location or you can enter the new location into the search box displayed on top of the page. You can do this by going to the ‘Teleport Mode’ on the top right corner of the page.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5:** Once you are sure about the new virtual location, click on ‘Move Here’ option.

![dr.fone virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

The New Location will now display on your iPhone/Android Device’s GPS system too. And Spotify will reflect it too. So, when you decide to change location on spotify using this method, the new location will reflect in all your apps. So, it’s hard to figure out that you’ve deliberately changed the location.



## **Part 4: How to Use a VPN to change Spotify Location?**

A Virtual Private Network App is also very useful for the Spotify change Region. But you need to keep two important points in mind - The Trial Versions do not provide complete protection and the features aren’t satisfactory. If you go for free VPNs available on the internet, you cannot be 100% sure that your data is safe. So, we have narrowed down the safest option for you. We suggest that you use Nord VPN if you cannot get your hands on a Location Spoofer.

Location Spoofers are much safer because they don’t maintain Log data like the VPNs. But if you have no other option left for Spotify update Location, then you can rely on NordVPN.

**Step 1:** Go to the AppStore or Google Play Store and choose NordVPN from the different VPN options available.

![nordvpn app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/nordvpn-location-servers-pic14.jpg)

**Step 2:** Sign Up and create your account on the app. The main use of a VPN is to mask your IP and give you a new server for internet surfing. So, once you log in, NordVPN will find the closest server for you.

![connect to server](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/quick-connect-new-server-pic15.jpg)

The automatic connect was made to United States - the closest server

![change server using spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/update-server-disconnect-pic16.jpg)

**Step 3:** In case you want to change to a specific country, You can go to ‘More Options’ and then choose Servers. Then go to All Countries and choose the country of your choice. Once you launch Spotify, the same will reflect there too.

![choose countries to change](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/countries-spotify-change-pic17.jpg)

The VPN works for all kinds of mobiles and it is very convenient to use. This is a good way to mask your IP address completely, so that no one can track your location change activity either. You can change servers several times a day to access content from across the world.

### Conclusion

If you know the right way to do it, changing Spotify Location After Moving to Another Country is no big deal. You have several tools that will assist you in the job. Unless you are faking your location, you can change location directly from Spotify Account Overview too. But if you want to Change Location in Spotify for more benefits, then you can use the tools we have mentioned to get the job done. You can cut down the premium payment prices, listen to exotic music from across the world and also stay up to date with the podcast releases too.

## Part 2: Fix 3utools Virtual Location Not Working Issue \[8 ways\]

### 1\. Solving the internet issues

Many times, 3uTools is unable to load the map, or the map crashes. The reason for this is that 3uTools is unable to connect to the Google Maps API. This can also occur if your internet connection is unstable.

If this is the cause of your **3uTools virtual location not working**, there isn't much you can do because this is a technical issue that can only be resolved by a technical expert. You might try relaunching 3uTools and repeating the spoofing procedure to refresh it. You may also try changing to "Mapbox" to see if it addresses the problem.

### 2\. Restarting and Closing the Software

When all of the aforementioned options fail, a decent option is to close the software and restart it after a few minutes. This is because the software frequently encounters an error, which is resolved when you close the software, making this a viable choice. We would also advise you to go to the Task Manager after closing the software and End Task it.

![restart the software](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-2.jpg)

### 3\. 3uTools reinstallation

The most common cause of any software not working is poor installation. Some crucial files or components of the software are left behind as a result of faulty installation. As a result, reinstallation or the usage of a different location spoofing program is the only choice remaining.

![reinstall 3utools](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-3.jpg)

### 4\. Restarting Your Computer

Restarting your computer is another easy option that many 3uTools users have found useful. If your virtual location feature stops working, simply close the app and restart your computer. This would delete the software from the Random access memory, as well as any bugs or errors that were preventing it from working.

![restart computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-4.jpg)

### 5\. Verifying the network connection and that the phone is unlocked

When you encounter a 'not working' problem when using the 3uTools software, the first thing you should do is check to ensure that your internet is operational and that there are no interruptions in your connections. You can resolve this by troubleshooting your internet and ensuring that its wire is correctly hooked in, as well as ensuring that your phone is already unlocked.

![verify the netwrok connection](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/fix-3utools-virtual-location-not-working-issue-5.jpg)

### 6\. Checking that all dependent components have been downloaded

Another major reason why many individuals experience problems with the 3uTools program is a lack of necessary components. While dependent components are normally downloaded along with the software, this is not always the case. As a result, it is critical to check that you have downloaded all necessary components to ensure that the software works properly.

### 7\. Changing the Source Map

Users frequently report that the map is not loaded. The maps on the 3uTools software fail to load as soon as users activate the virtual location option. You can attempt "Load embedded maps" to solve this issue.

Alternatively, change the source map between Google Maps and Open Street Maps.

Many customers have reported encountering the "3uTools virtual location developer image load failed" problem, with the majority of them appearing to be iOS 17 users. 3uTools either does not load the location images or the screen becomes frozen.

## Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On Nubia Z50 Ultra?

Airplane mode is a feature available on all smartphones and other electronic devices that stops the signal transmissions from the Nubia Z50 Ultra devices. Also known as flight or airplane mode, this feature will disconnect the wireless functions, including cellular connection, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

![airplane mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/airplane-mode.jpg)

The feature's name says that it was introduced to cut off any radio transmission during the flight to avoid any communication interference. However, the feature must be enabled while taking a flight, and if you need to be disconnected from the signals, you can even use the feature outside the plane.

If you have **enabled airplane mode on your Nubia Z50 Ultra** or Android device and think it will also block your GPS location, you are wrong. Know why airplane mode does not turn off GPS location and other ways to **avoid getting tracked with or without Airplane Mode.**


## Part 1: Does Airplane Mode Turn off location?

As we mentioned above, while you put your phone on airplane mode, the cellular radio, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is disabled, but not the GPS location.

The GPS works on a different technology where the signals are received from the satellite and are not dependent on the network or cellular services. So, when the airplane mode is enabled, the GPS location is not turned off.

## Part 2: Can Your Location Be tailed on Airplane Mode?

Yes, if you have not disabled the GPS feature, your location can be tailed on an Airplane mode as the flight mode only disables the cellular connection and Wi-Fi. So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode is no solution for stopping the GPS tracking on your phone, though there are other workarounds available for this.

## Part 3: How to Prevent Phones from Being Tailed?

The GPS feature of your phone, besides assisting you, is also a way any person or third-party app can keep track, which can hamper your privacy and be annoying. So, for privacy or any other reason, if you are looking for ways to prevent your phones from being tailed, check out the solutions for iDevices and Android below.

### 3.1. How to stop GPS tracking on Nubia Z50 Ultras?

**Step 2**. Enable the Airplane Mode or turn off the Wi-Fi and Cellular icon.

**Step 3**. Next, you need to disable the GPS radio. On some of the Nubia Z50 Ultra devices, there is a separate setting for this. Go to Settings > Privacy> Location Services. The list of the apps using the location services will appear. Move the toggle at the Location Services to turn it off.

![switch off gps on idevices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/switch-off-gps-idevice-2.jpg)

## Part 5: People Also ask about Airplane Mode

### Q1: Can An iPhone Be Traced While off?

No, it cannot be traced when an iPhone or any other phone is switched off. For example, when an iPhone is switched off, its GPS is not activated, and thus it cannot be traced.

### Q2: Does Find My iPhone Work on Airplane Mode?

No, the Find My iPhone feature does not work in Airplane mode because the location services need a network connection, and thus in Airplane mode, the Nubia Z50 Ultra device is offline, and it isn't easy to track the Nubia Z50 Ultra device.

### Q3: Does airplane mode turn off life360

Life360 is a helpful app for tracking your friends, family, and other people. This app tracks your GPS location and displays it to all the selected members in a circle. When the airplane mode on your device is enabled, the network will be disconnected, and thus Life360 will not be able to update your location to the members in the circle. Therefore, during **airplane mode, Life360** will not update your site.

## Wrap it up

So, it can be concluded that Airplane Mode disconnects you from the cellular network and Wi-Fi. Therefore, to stop getting traced, you need to disable your location services along with the airplane mode. Using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an excellent alternative to stop the GPS location as the software will help you set a fake location, and your actual location will remain hidden from all.
