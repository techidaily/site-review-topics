_“Yesterday, my iPhone stopped working suddenly. I have been trying multiple ways to fix it since then; even tried the force reboot method. Should I simply reset my iPhone? How do I do it without losing my device data?”_

Resetting an iPhone can sometimes become a necessity, whether due to sudden freezing up of your device, software glitches, or slow performance. Often, when your iPhone gets stuck on the Apple logo or suddenly crashes, you can reset your iPhone to fix this minor issue.

A factory reset is also necessary if you want to sell your iPhone and want to start fresh. When resetting your iPhone, it will become an empty slate with no pictures, contacts, videos, downloaded applications, playlists, or anything else. An iPhone reset restores your iPhone to its initial configuration and original factory settings.

However, be careful with this method as resetting your iPhone deletes all files & settings on the device.  For those looking to reset iPhone without losing their precious data, this blog is the answer. Let’s read on to find some simple ways to do so while keeping our data intact.

## **How to reset your iPhone without Losing Data?**

Before starting, it’s crucial to [back up your iPhone data](https://www.stellarinfo.com/article/how-to-back-up-iphone.php) to avoid losing important files and folders. You can back up your iPhone using iCloud, iTunes, or Finder on Mac or PC.

Next, follow the step-by-step instructions on resetting an iPhone using iPhone Settings, iPhone erasure software, and iTunes.

### **Method 1: Reset iPhone Without Losing Data via Settings**

To reset iPhone without losing data, you need to use the **‘Reset’** feature in your iPhone. This feature has different options on how you would like to reset- whether through the **‘Reset All Settings’** or the **‘Reset Network Settings’** option.

The **Reset All Settings** option will remove or reset privacy settings, keyword dictionary, location settings, etc., to default. At the same time, **Reset Network Settings** will remove previously used networks and VPN settings. Resetting the Network Settings will turn off the cellular data roaming and remove previously used Wi-Fi settings of your iPhone.

Moreover, no data or media is deleted from iPhone when choosing the Reset All Settings or Reset Network Settings option.

**Steps to Reset iPhone Using the ‘Reset All Settings’ option**

- On the **iPhone**, navigate to **Settings** > **General**.
- Tap on **Transfer** **or** **Reset** **iPhone**.
- Click **Reset** options.

- Next, click the **Reset All Settings** option.
