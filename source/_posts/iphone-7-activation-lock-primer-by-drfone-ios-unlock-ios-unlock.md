## Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (iPhone 7)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone 7 but forgot to erase the device before submitting and consequently, the device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that iPhone 7 to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

Disabling Activation Lock on iPhone 7 is easy if you have the Apple ID credentials that are associated with the iPhone 7.

![Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/1.avif)

- **Step 1**: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the device to factory settings.
- **Step 2**: When you set up the device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the device. Do that and you are golden!

### Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the device and removing the device from the associated iCloud account.

- **Step 1**: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at [https://icloud.com](https://secure.2checkout.com/order/cart.php?PRODS=4719741&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875).
- **Step 2**: Sign In and go to `Find iPhone`.

![Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/2.avif)

- **Step 3**: Click All Devices and select the device that was sold to the user.
- **Step 4**: Click Erase iPhone and if the device is still there after the erase is complete, click Remove From Account.

![Erase iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/3.avif)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the iPhone in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the iPhone and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/bypass-iphone-activation-lock/4.avif)

- **Step 1**: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- **Step 2**: Select Devices under Intune.
- **Step 3**: Select All Devices.
- **Step 4**: Locate the device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- **Step 5**: Under the Overview pane of the device, select Wipe.
- **Step 6**: When the device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

The device will be reset, and employees can set it up again with a new Apple ID.




## Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your iPhone 7 13 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Bypassing Activation Lock with a Professional Tool

For iPhone 5S to iPhone 7 users who prefer an easier way to remove Activation Lock, `Wondershare Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)` is a suitable option.

## Difference Between Activation Lock and Locked Apple ID

Apple being Apple, does a lot to make sure that users get the smoothest experience possible when interacting with their Apple products, both hardware, and software. Yet, sometimes, the messaging gets confusing, and people are not sure what is what. One such thing is the difference between iCloud Activation Lock and Apple ID Lock. While people are more likely to encounter Activation Lock and less likely to encounter Apple ID Lock, they are often confused when they encounter Apple ID Lock and struggle to figure out what that means and how to resolve the issue.

Activation Lock is when your supported Apple device is locked for a number of reasons. The most common reason is a stolen device that was locked by its owner, however, there are other perfectly valid reasons such as an outgoing employee forgetting to sign out and erase their Apple device before submitting it back. The IT department would not be able to reset that device without turning off Find My Phone and Activation Lock on the device.

A locked Apple ID usually happens when the user has forgotten their password to their Apple ID account and attempts to figure out the password have been unsuccessful. Sometimes, Apple ID gets locked automatically under some conditions, and that requires users to reset their password to gain access. A locked Apple ID does not mean that your device is locked for your use. You can keep using it so long as you do not try to use another Apple ID with it since to do that you would have to sign out of your current Apple ID (which is locked) and you won't be able to do that. On the other hand, Activation Lock renders the entire device unusable till the lock is cleared.

![Locked Apple ID](https://tools.techidaily.com/images/apps/wondershare/dr.fone-ios-unlock/unlock-iphone-without-apple-id/1.webp)

In short, Apple ID Lock is about a user's account with Apple, akin to how Google Account works on Android devices. Apple ID Lock locks a user's account with Apple while retaining complete usage of the device whereas Activation Lock locks the device and prevents anyone from using it until the correct credentials are entered. This is about verifying the ownership of the device and works to deter theft of Apple devices.

## Reasons for Locked Apple ID

There can be a few reasons why your Apple ID is locked. You forgot the password and now it is locked since you entered the wrong password too many times. A scarier prospect, albeit a real one, is that some malicious actor attempted to login into your Apple ID account but failed. Had they succeeded, you would have gotten a message that 'your Apple ID is being used on another device' now.

Apple does a lot to ensure that your Apple ID remains safe. You trust Apple with a lot of your data, including financial data by way of your credit cards associated with Apple ID to make purchases on the App Store and iTunes Store. Therefore, some of the time, Apple preempts issues by proactively locking up your Apple ID or even disabling it. It goes without saying that sometimes it is something so simple as a software error that is believed to have locked up Apple IDs for many users around the world a while ago. It is also entirely possible that it was some malicious actor probing the servers for accounts.

All of these will result in a locked Apple ID that users will have to reset their password to in order to gain access back.

## Unlock Disabled iPhone 7 Without A Computer

here are millions in the world who do not use the traditional computer so to speak. They have entered the post-PC era as they say, and their needs are met without a regular desktop or a laptop. They live wirelessly. They travel the world. Are you one of them? How would you unlock disabled iPhone 7 with no desktop/ laptop computer around? You have a few options.

You can use your other iOS device with Find My iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 7 or you can use the iCloud website from your other device and Find iPhone app to unlock your disabled iPhone 7.

The second option is to get a loaner device from someone you know. A loaner device is a device you borrow from someone to use for a purpose and return it when you are done with it. In this case, you can ask for a computer from someone you know and use it to unlock your disabled iPhone 7 and return the device back. That way, you can use iTunes or macOS Finder if you’re more favorable to using that method.

When using a computer, the simplest, easiest, most flexible, and robust method to unlock disabled iPhone 7 is using third-party tools such as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) – Screen Unlock (iOS). However, [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is not just for troubleshooting and unlocking your disabled devices. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) is like that multi-utility knife that can do a variety of things.

Using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) you can not only unlock your iPhone 7 with ease, you can also use it periodically as a backup and restore tool that gives power in your hands. How does it do that? When you launched [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), you had several modules to choose from and you chose Screen Unlock to unlock your disabled device. Instead of that, you can choose the Phone Backup module to backup and restore data from and to your device. Why would you use a third-party tool to backup and restore?

As you may be aware, using iTunes or macOS Finder allows you to backup and restore data onto your iPhone easily, but, the one glaring omission here is that it does not allow you to choose what you want to backup and what you want to restore. This is a much-coveted feature that is glaringly absent from the Apple world so far, and with [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/)'s iOS Phone Backup feature you can have that choice in your hands, just like you do with Android. [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/) allows you to choose what you want to backup, so, you can back up just your photos, just your text messages, just your files, or any combination thereof, for the matter. And, when it comes to restore, you can restore selectively as well. So, suppose you backed up your entire data using [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/ios-unlock-dr-fone-wondershare/), now you can restore just the text messages if you so want.
