We use them to stay connected with our friends and family, stay up to date with the latest trends, stream media, and store a huge amount of photos and videos.

We have curated a list of the 8 best iPhone data recovery software, which anyone can use to restore and recover iPhone text messages and data deleted from an iPhone or another iOS device.

## Factors to Consider While Choosing a Deleted iPhone Texts Recovery Software

Before looking at the list of the best iPhone data recovery software to recover deleted text messages, let’s take a look at various factors that one should keep in mind while choosing the right data recovery software.

![factors to consider when looking for an iPhone text recovery software](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-8b4e845/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-Recovery-Software-1024x576.jpg)

- **Reliability** –It is best to choose an iPhone data recovery software from a reliable brand as they have the expertise to back their claim.
- **Features** – Various iPhone recovery software can recover various types of deleted data like photos, videos, messages, etc. They can also be used to perform deleted SMS recovery for recovering deleted text messages. As iPhone data is precious and important, selecting a brand that could help us recover deleted iPhone data from other sources like external storage media is wise.
- **User Reviews** – User reviews help new users and potential buyers in making their choice. Reviews are also helpful as they add to the legitimacy of software and its claims. Therefore, one should always read the reviews and select the right iPhone data recovery software.
- **Data Recovery Performance** – This is an important factor that everyone should consider before choosing the right iPhone data recovery software. Great performance always makes the software stand out from the rest.
