## How to Recover deleted pictures on iPhone? 5 Best Solutions

For many iPhone users, photos are the most important data stored on their device – so losing those photos can be a disaster.

However, even if you accidentally deleted some or all of your pictures on iPhone, you can get them back.

We'll discuss how to recover deleted photos on your iPhone with or without backup.

## **How to Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone?**

There are five best solutions to recover deleted pictures on iPhone. Use the solution that fits your needs and helps you recover your lost pictures.

### 1\. Recover Deleted Pictures on iPhone from Recently Deleted Albums

Pictures taken with the iPhone Camera application are saved by default in the Photos application. If a photo or video is deleted, it's moved to the Recently Deleted folder in the Photos app. This folder is the same as your computer’s Recycle Bin and retains the deleted photos for 30 days. Once this period expires, your photos are permanently deleted from this folder. Perform these steps if you want to recover recently deleted photos on your iPhone:

- Open the **Photos** app.
- Tap on **Albums** at the bottom.

It sets the iOS device to the original factory settings. The software works with all iPhone variants including series of iPhone 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, XS MAX, XS, XR, X, 8, and below. It supports latest iOS 16 and below versions.

**Step 6:** In the **Erase Process** dialog box, select **Yes**.

**Step 7:** In **Data Erase Completes** dialog box, click **OK**.

All the data gets erased permanently beyond recovery from your iPhone or iPad.

### **Method 3: Recover forgotten Apple ID and Password to reset iPhone**

Apple ID password is necessary to use iPhone applications and services. So if you are not planning to sell off your iPhone or iPad, it is best to first recover the forgotten Apple ID password and then reset your iOS device using the **‘Erase All Content and Settings’** option in the iPhone Settings.

You can use iPhone Settings, Apple Support app, Find My iPhone, or visit [Apple account page](https://appleid.apple.com/)  to recover lost Apple ID password.

#### **Reset iPhone with Apple ID password:**

1. Go to **Settings > General > Reset.**
2. Click on **Erase All Content and Settings.**

### **Conclusion**

Without the Apple ID and password, you cannot reset your iOS device through the traditional ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ method. Either you recover the forgotten Apple ID and password or use any of the two methods shared above to factory reset the iPhone without Apple ID.

You can put the iPhone to Recovery Mode and use iTunes on your computer to reset the iOS device without Apple ID. Other than this, a simpler way to permanently delete everything on your iPhone is by using Stellar iPhone Eraser software. The software doesn’t ask for Apple ID through the process. It quickly resets your iPhone or iPad and brings it to original settings by erasing complete data on it.
