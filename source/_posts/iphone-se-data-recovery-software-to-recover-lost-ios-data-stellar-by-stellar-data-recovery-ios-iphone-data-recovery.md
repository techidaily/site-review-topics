## **2\. Restore Calendar on iPhone using iPhone data recovery software**

A simpler, more effective and convenient way to recover Calendar app is by using a professional iPhone recovery software, such as [Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/data-recovery-ios/). Regardless of the reason for loss – deletion, factory reset, or jailbreak etc., the software can restore the app data on your device.

The DIY tool is safe, easy-to-use, and quick to restore. It thoroughly scans the iOS device (iPhone and iPad), iTunes, and iCloud to recover the lost calendar.

## **Conclusion**

Apple has tried to address the users’ data loss issues through multiple backup solutions — iTunes, iCloud, and iCloud.com. However, these native backup-based recovery solutions fall short when the user needs to recover specific data; though, you can easily recover lost Calendar from these backup options, but you end up replacing every existing data on your device!

Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone fills in this gap really well. It not only recovers lost or deleted Calendar in situations of jailbreak, water damage, factory reset, and Black Screen of Death, etc., but also recovers specific data that you want.
