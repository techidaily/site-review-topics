**Step 12)** Exit from the tool and go to the selected location to access the Camera Roll and Photo Stream recovered pictures.

**Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone also restores data from the following:**

- If you are looking to recover data from your iPhone backup such as iTunes backup or iCloud backup, then you need to select Recover from iTunes backup or Recover from iCloud backup options. The tool also allows importing files from Windows and Mac machines to iPhones.
- After the scan is completed, the tool will display all integrated components of deleted iTunes backup or iCloud backup files within its panel from where it can be selected as per priority and preferences. The powerful algorithms are fully advanced to recover every single bit of data.
- The tool also recovers encrypted iOS iTunes backup files and restores it back to the device. You can also recover lost or deleted data from iPad using the iPhone Data Recovery tool. Backup files of small, medium and large scale are handled effectively by the tool.
- The tool also recovers bookmarks deleted accidentally from your iPhone default browser Safari. Since bookmarks hold information about useful links and websites, this feature can be very helpful for technically savvy users.
