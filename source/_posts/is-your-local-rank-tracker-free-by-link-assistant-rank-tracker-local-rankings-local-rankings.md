## How to check accurate local SEO rankings?

Local Rank Tracker Tool is a part of SEO PowerSuite, a software that helps you to check accurate rankings in local search and on Google Maps. It is a powerful tool that allows you to track your website's rankings in local search results and on Google Maps. It is a great tool for local businesses that want to improve their online visibility and attract more customers.

### Local search results are highly specific…

Searcher's proximity to the place of business is an important ranking factor: people from two different cities get completely different results.

For location-based queries, a specific Local Pack block shows up with three relevant local businesses and a link to the Google Maps view.
