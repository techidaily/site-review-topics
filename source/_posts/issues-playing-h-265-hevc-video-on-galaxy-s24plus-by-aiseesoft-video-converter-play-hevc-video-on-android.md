      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy S24+, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy S24+ cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S24+ would be a workable solution.

    My Samsung Galaxy S24+ won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a Samsung Galaxy S24+ which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my Samsung Galaxy S24+? I would really appreciate any help."
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
    This is probably because your Samsung Galaxy S24+ doesn’t have enough power to handle 4K HEVC files. In this situation, we would recommend converting them to a format that is well supported by your Samsung Galaxy S24+ first.
