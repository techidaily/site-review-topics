      If your movie contains a audio codec that is not supported by Huawei P60, you may probably encounter audio lost issues when playing it. If that’s the case, we would recommend converting the movie to a format that is compatible with your Huawei P60 first, such as H.264 AAC encoded MP4, which Huawei P60 will recognize and handle well.
