    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Huawei Nova Y91 and it failed terribly. Does Huawei Nova Y91 come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Huawei Nova Y91 on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
