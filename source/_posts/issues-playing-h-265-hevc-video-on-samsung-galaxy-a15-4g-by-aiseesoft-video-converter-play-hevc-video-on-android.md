      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy A15 4G would be a workable solution.

    How can I play HEVC files on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G?

    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Samsung Galaxy A15 4G and it failed terribly. Does Samsung Galaxy A15 4G come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Samsung Galaxy A15 4G on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
