      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video.

But if your Xiaomi 14 struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi 14 first. That’s where an HEVC to Xiaomi 14 converter comes in.
