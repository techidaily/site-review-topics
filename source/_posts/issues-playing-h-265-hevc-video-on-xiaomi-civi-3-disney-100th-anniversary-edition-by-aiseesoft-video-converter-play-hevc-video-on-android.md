      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition would be a workable solution.

      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition first. That’s where an HEVC to Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition converter comes in.
