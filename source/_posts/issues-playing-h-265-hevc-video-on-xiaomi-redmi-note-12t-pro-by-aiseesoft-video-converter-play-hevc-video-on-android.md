      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro would be a workable solution.

    How can I play HEVC files on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro?

    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro and it failed terribly. Does Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
