      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 4G would be a workable solution.
