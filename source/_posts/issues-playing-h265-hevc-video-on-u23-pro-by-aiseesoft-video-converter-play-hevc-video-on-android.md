      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your HTC U23 Pro, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your HTC U23 Pro cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your HTC U23 Pro would be a workable solution.

    My HTC U23 Pro won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a HTC U23 Pro which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my HTC U23 Pro? I would really appreciate any help."
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
    This is probably because your HTC U23 Pro doesn’t have enough power to handle 4K HEVC files. In this situation, we would recommend converting them to a format that is well supported by your HTC U23 Pro first.
