      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi A2, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi A2 cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi A2 would be a workable solution.
