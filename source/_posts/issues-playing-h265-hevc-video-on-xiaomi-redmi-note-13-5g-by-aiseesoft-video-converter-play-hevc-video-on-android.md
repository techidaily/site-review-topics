      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G would be a workable solution.

    Why convert HEVC/H.265 video for Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G first. That’s where an HEVC to Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 5G converter comes in.
