description: MKV is a container format. If it holds a video or audio codec that is not supported by Xiaomi 13T, you will fail to play. In that case, we would recommend converting MKV to H.264 MP4 for Xiaomi 13T playback.

    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Xiaomi 13T plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Xiaomi 13T.
