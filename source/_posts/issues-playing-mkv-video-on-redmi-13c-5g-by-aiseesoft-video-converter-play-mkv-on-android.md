    Whether you are downloading videos from the Internet or getting them from your friends, there is a high chance that you will come across MKV files. MKV is  not an audio or video compression format, but a multimedia container format. An MKV container can incorporate audio, video, and subtitles into a single file - even if those elements use different types of encoding. For example, you could have an MKV file that contains H.264 or HEVC video and something like AAC, MP3 or AC3 for audio. If the MKV contains a video or audio codec that is not compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G, you will need to convert them first for a smooth playback performance. This requires a good MKV to Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G converter. The following guide explains how to convert MKV to H.264 MP4 for playing on Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G smoothly.
