  <p>
    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Samsung Galaxy M34 plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Samsung Galaxy M34.

  Video is laggy when playing 4K .mkv on my Samsung Galaxy M34
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
  “I'm using moboplayer to watch a 4K MKV show but the video is very laggy. I don't know if this is a software issue or the Samsung Galaxy M34 is simply not fast enough to run high quality videos. I read somewhere that converting the video will make it run smoother. Is this true? And if so how do I convert it and into what format? I would really appreciate any help.”
