  <p>
    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition.

  Video is laggy when playing 4K .mkv on my Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
  “I'm using moboplayer to watch a 4K MKV show but the video is very laggy. I don't know if this is a software issue or the Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition is simply not fast enough to run high quality videos. I read somewhere that converting the video will make it run smoother. Is this true? And if so how do I convert it and into what format? I would really appreciate any help.”
