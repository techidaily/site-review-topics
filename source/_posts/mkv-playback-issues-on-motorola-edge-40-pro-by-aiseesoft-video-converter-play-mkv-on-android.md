    Whether you are downloading videos from the Internet or getting them from your friends, there is a high chance that you will come across MKV files. MKV is  not an audio or video compression format, but a multimedia container format. An MKV container can incorporate audio, video, and subtitles into a single file - even if those elements use different types of encoding. For example, you could have an MKV file that contains H.264 or HEVC video and something like AAC, MP3 or AC3 for audio. If the MKV contains a video or audio codec that is not compatible with your Motorola Edge 40 Pro, you will need to convert them first for a smooth playback performance. This requires a good MKV to Motorola Edge 40 Pro converter. The following guide explains how to convert MKV to H.264 MP4 for playing on Motorola Edge 40 Pro smoothly.
