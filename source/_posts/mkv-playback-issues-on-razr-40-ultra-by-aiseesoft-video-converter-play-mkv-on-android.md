  Video is laggy when playing 4K .mkv on my Motorola Razr 40 Ultra
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
  “I'm using moboplayer to watch a 4K MKV show but the video is very laggy. I don't know if this is a software issue or the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra is simply not fast enough to run high quality videos. I read somewhere that converting the video will make it run smoother. Is this true? And if so how do I convert it and into what format? I would really appreciate any help.”
