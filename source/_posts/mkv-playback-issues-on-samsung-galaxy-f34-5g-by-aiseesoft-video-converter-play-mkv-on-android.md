    Does Samsung Galaxy F34 5G have native support for MKV files? As a matter of fact, most Android devices need to install a third party media player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, Mobo Player, etc.) to watch MKV content. If for some reason this method doesn’t work for you, you need to convert MKV files to a format that is compatible with Samsung Galaxy F34 5G prior, such as H.264 MP4.

    If you’re like me, you’ll probably have several MKV videos in your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G. MKV is a container format. The stock player of Samsung Galaxy F34 5G doesn’t support playing MKV files yet. Fortunately, such a problem is solved by using a third party media player app. My favorite choice for playing MKV files on Samsung Galaxy F34 5G is VLC media player - mostly because it has built-in support and doesn’t require that you install anything else. But sadly this way doesn’t work all the time, especially when you try to play a .MKV file with high bitrates or high resolutions. In that case, I would recommend converting MKV to H.264 encoded MP4 first. This requires a helpful MKV to Samsung Galaxy F34 5G converter. The following guide will walk you through how to do this via using such a converter app.
