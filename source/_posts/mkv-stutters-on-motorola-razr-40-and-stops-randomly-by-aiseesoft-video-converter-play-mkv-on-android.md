    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Motorola Razr 40 plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Motorola Razr 40.

    If you’re like me, you’ll probably have several MKV videos in your Motorola Razr 40. MKV is a container format. The stock player of Motorola Razr 40 doesn’t support playing MKV files yet. Fortunately, such a problem is solved by using a third party media player app. My favorite choice for playing MKV files on Motorola Razr 40 is VLC media player - mostly because it has built-in support and doesn’t require that you install anything else. But sadly this way doesn’t work all the time, especially when you try to play a .MKV file with high bitrates or high resolutions. In that case, I would recommend converting MKV to H.264 encoded MP4 first. This requires a helpful MKV to Motorola Razr 40 converter. The following guide will walk you through how to do this via using such a converter app.
