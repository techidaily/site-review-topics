      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Motorola Moto G24, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Motorola Moto G24 cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Motorola Moto G24 would be a workable solution.

    My Motorola Moto G24 won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a Motorola Moto G24 which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my Motorola Moto G24? I would really appreciate any help."
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
    This is probably because your Motorola Moto G24 doesn’t have enough power to handle 4K HEVC files. In this situation, we would recommend converting them to a format that is well supported by your Motorola Moto G24 first.
