    If you’re like me, you’ll probably have several MKV videos in your Motorola Moto G84 5G. MKV is a container format. The stock player of Motorola Moto G84 5G doesn’t support playing MKV files yet. Fortunately, such a problem is solved by using a third party media player app. My favorite choice for playing MKV files on Motorola Moto G84 5G is VLC media player - mostly because it has built-in support and doesn’t require that you install anything else. But sadly this way doesn’t work all the time, especially when you try to play a .MKV file with high bitrates or high resolutions. In that case, I would recommend converting MKV to H.264 encoded MP4 first. This requires a helpful MKV to Motorola Moto G84 5G converter. The following guide will walk you through how to do this via using such a converter app.
