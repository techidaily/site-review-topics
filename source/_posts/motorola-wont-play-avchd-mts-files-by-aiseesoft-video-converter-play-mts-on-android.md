    Wanna watch MTS clips copied from your AVCHD camera on Motorola Moto G34 5G? AVCHD is a popular file-based format for digital recording and playback of high-definition video. Most Android phones or tablets lack native support for AVCHD MTS footage. You can either use a third party media player like VLC or MX player to play MTS files on your Motorola Moto G34 5G, or convert AVCHD footage to MP4 format that is well compatible with Motorola Moto G34 5G.

  “I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do with AVCHD .mts files on my Motorola Moto G34 5G. They were taken with a Panasonic camera. I’d like to watch them on Motorola Moto G34 5G, but it refused to play them. So I'm stuck. Has anyone else figured out how to play the files in this .mts format on Motorola Moto G34 5G? Any suggestions?”

  The native video player on your Motorola Moto G34 5G will not support AVCHD files. However, you have two options to go through the issue. You can either install a third party video player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, MoboPlayer, etc.) or convert AVCHD .mts files to MP4 format via using a converter app. Check out a guide on how to re-encode AVCHD .mts files for playing on Motorola Moto G34 5G.
