    “My MOV video file fails to open on HTC U23 Pro . Tried to play it through RockPlayer, MoboPlayer, and VLC, but .mov video simply doesn’t play. I receive a black screen every time I double-click my .mov file. What should I do?”

    MOV is a container format. If your MOV file holds a video or audio codec that HTC U23 Pro doesn’t support, you will probably fail to play the MOV file. In that case, you will need to convert it first. That’s where an MOV to HTC U23 Pro  converter comes in. Check a simple guide on how to re-encode MOV files to H.264 MP4 for viewing on HTC U23 Pro  smoothly.
