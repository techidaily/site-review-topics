  MP4 is among Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) supported video formats, however, some users still encounter incompatibility issues when playing MP4 files on Motorola Moto G 5G (2023). Why does this happen? The reason is that MP4 is a container format which may contain multiple video and audio streams encoded with various codecs. Although Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) is compatible with MP4 video files, it also requires the MP4 file to be encoded in the way that is recognized by your particular device model. Some MP4 videos will not play on Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) due to the failure of codec recognition. In that case, you will need to convert the files to Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) supported H.264 MP4 format. Check a guide on how to do this below.
