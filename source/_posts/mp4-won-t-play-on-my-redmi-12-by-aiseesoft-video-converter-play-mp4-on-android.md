  “Hi, any ideas why my Xiaomi Redmi 12 doesn't play MP4 videos. I've copied several MP4 clips onto my SD card. It turns up in the media player app. But when I go to play it a popup message saying something like ‘this video cannot be played’. Strangely I earlier put an AVI video onto the same SD card. I can play this AVI video fine in the same video player app. MP4 should be playable on Xiaomi Redmi 12. Why did this happen? Is there anything I can do to solve the issue? Thanks for any help.”
