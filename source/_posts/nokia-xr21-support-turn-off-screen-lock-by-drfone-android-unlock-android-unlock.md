description: The main reason to set up some sort of lock screen security on your Nokia XR21 is to keep strangers (or friends) from checking out your messages or private pictures. Beyond that, you don’t want anyone who dares to steal your Nokia XR21 to get full access to your mails, pictures or other sensitive data. But what if you’re the one who cannot access your Nokia XR21? You could forget your PIN or pattern, right? Or someone pranks you by setting up a lock screen pattern and just leaves you struggling with it.
