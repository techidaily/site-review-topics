**‘Open and Repair’ doesn’t work:** Try an **alternative** solution i.e. **[Stellar Repair for Excel](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/)** to recover everything from corrupt Excel files.

## **How to Fix Excel file that Won’t Open**

If your workbook is opening in Excel, there are two options to recover its data. It would be best if you try to perform one, and if you are unsuccessful, move on to the next.

### **Revert the workbook to the version that was saved before the corruption**

- Launch Excel and click **File** -> **Open**

![Excel File Open](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/File-and-Open.png)

- Select the file that is corrupted and open it
- Click ‘**Yes**’ to save the copy of the workbook that was saved before corruption

**Important Note:** If you use this method, you will lose all changes made to the file after it was corrupted.

#### **Save the workbook in the SYLK file format**

- Launch Excel and click **File** -> **Save As**.
- In the **Save as Type** field, select **SYLK (Symbolic Link)** from the drop-down menu, and click **Save**.

![Save Excel Workbook in SYLK File Format ](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SYLK-format.png)

- To save only the active sheet in the workbook, click **OK**. The system will display a message that the sheet has features that are not compatible with the SYLK file format.
- Click **Yes**.
- In Excel click **File** -> **Open**.
- Select the file that you saved in SYLK file format and open it.
- In Excel click **File** -> **Save As**.
- In the **Save as Type** field, select **Excel Workbook** from the drop-down menu.
- In the **File Name** field, type a new name for your workbook and click **Save**.

The SYLK file format will filter out the corrupted elements from your workbook, thereby restoring your data.

> **Important Note:** Using this method you only be able to salvage the active sheet in the workbook.

## **How to Open/Fix an Excel file** **that cannot be opened**

In this case too, there are two options to recover the data. Try to perform one, and if you are unsuccessful, move on to the next.

**Set the calculation option to Manual**

- Launch Excel and click **File** -> **New**.

![Stellar](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/New-file.png)

- From the **Available Templates** window, select **Blank workbook**.

![Stellar](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Blank-workbook.png)

- Click **File** -> **Options**.

![Stellar](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Calculation-Options.png)

- Click **OK**.
- In Excel click **File** -> **Open**.
- Select the corrupted file and open it.

The system opens the corrupted file. Since the workbook won’t be calculated, it might open.

## **Link the workbook to external references**

- Launch Excel and click **File** -> **Open**.
- Copy the name of the corrupted file and click **Cancel**.
- In Excel click **File** -> **New**.
- From the **Available Templates** window, select **Blank workbook**.
- In the new workbook, on cell A1, type the following:

\=File Name!A1

**In the above command, the filename is the name of the corrupted file.**

- On the **Update Values** dialog box, select the corrupted file and click **OK**.
- On the **Select Sheet** dialog box, select the sheet and click **OK**.
- Select cell A1. Select the same range of rows and columns as occupied by the data in the corrupted sheet, including cell A1.
- Under the **Home** tab, in the **Clipboard** section, click **Paste**.
- While the range of rows and columns are still selected, click **Copy**.
- Click the **Paste**
- Under **Paste Values**, click **Values**.

**Note:** This method lets you recover only the data but not the values and formulas from the workbook.

## **Alternative Solution**

In addition to the above-mentioned techniques, you can also use macros to extract data from a corrupted workbook. However, macros are generally risky, and executing them needs prior technical knowledge.

Thus, if the above methods do not yield the desired results, a quick and easy way for reconstructing Excel files is to use [Excel Recovery Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/). Stellar Repair for MS SQL software is the best choice for rebuilding damaged Excel files and restoring everything to a new Excel file. The product lets you recover table, chart, chart-sheet, cell comment, image, formula, sort and filter data from damaged workbooks and also allows you to fix multiple files at one go.

## **Wrapping it up**

Though one of the above-mentioned techniques should recover Excel file if ‘_**Open and Repair’ utility doesn’t work**_, in case you’ve reached nowhere even after using them, contact Microsoft support for more help.
