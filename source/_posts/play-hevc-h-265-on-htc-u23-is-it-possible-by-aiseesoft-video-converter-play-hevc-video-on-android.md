  <p>
      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your HTC U23 struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your HTC U23 first. That’s where an HEVC to HTC U23 converter comes in.
