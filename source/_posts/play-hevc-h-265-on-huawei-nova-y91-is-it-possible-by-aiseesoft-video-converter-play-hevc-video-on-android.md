  <p>
      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your Huawei Nova Y91 struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Huawei Nova Y91 first. That’s where an HEVC to Huawei Nova Y91 converter comes in.
