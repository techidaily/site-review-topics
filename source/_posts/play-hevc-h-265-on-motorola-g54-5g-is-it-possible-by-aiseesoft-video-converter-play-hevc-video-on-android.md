    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Motorola G54 5G and it failed terribly. Does Motorola G54 5G come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Motorola G54 5G on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
