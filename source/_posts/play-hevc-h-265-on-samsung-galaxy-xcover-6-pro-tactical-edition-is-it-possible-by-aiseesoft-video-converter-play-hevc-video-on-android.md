      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy XCover 6 Pro Tactical Edition would be a workable solution.
