      If your movie contains a audio codec that is not supported by Xiaomi 13 Ultra, you may probably encounter audio lost issues when playing it. If that’s the case, we would recommend converting the movie to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi 13 Ultra first, such as H.264 AAC encoded MP4, which Xiaomi 13 Ultra will recognize and handle well.
