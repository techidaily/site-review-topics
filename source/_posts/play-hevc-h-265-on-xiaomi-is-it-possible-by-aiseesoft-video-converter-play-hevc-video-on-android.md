    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro and it failed terribly. Does Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
