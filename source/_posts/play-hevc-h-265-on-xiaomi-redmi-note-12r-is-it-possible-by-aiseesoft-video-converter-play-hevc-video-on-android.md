      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R would be a workable solution.

    My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R won’t play 4K HEVC, how to resolve?
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
    "Hi all, I have a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R which is working very fine for me. Everything is fine and smooth … except 4K HEVC video playback. It can read all videos up to 1080p fluently. However, all 4K HEVC video files are unwatchable: frames are freezing every seconds. How can I get the 4K HEVC video playing smoothly on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R? I would really appreciate any help."

<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-content">
  <p>
    This is probably because your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R doesn’t have enough power to handle 4K HEVC files. In this situation, we would recommend converting them to a format that is well supported by your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R first.
