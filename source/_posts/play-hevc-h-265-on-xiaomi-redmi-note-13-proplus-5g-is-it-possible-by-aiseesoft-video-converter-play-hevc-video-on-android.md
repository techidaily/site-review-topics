      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G would be a workable solution.
