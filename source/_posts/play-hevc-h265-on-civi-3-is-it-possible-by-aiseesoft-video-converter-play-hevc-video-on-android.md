    "I tried to play a .mkv file encoded with HEVC on Xiaomi Civi 3 and it failed terribly. Does Xiaomi Civi 3 come with native support for HEVC? If not, is there any workaround to make it possible? I have a couple of MKV movies with HEVC codec and I’d like to watch them on my Xiaomi Civi 3 on public vehicles. Please help. Thanks."
