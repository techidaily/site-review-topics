      If you are experiencing choppy, stuttering, or broken up playback when viewing HEVC video on your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, it is probably because your device doesn’t support the new HEVC H.265 codec, or your video has high specifications that your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cannot handle. If that’s the case, converting the HEVC video to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra would be a workable solution.

    Why convert HEVC/H.265 video for Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra?

  <p>
      Depending on hardware, software, video/audio formats/codecs, frame rate, bitrate, file sizes and much more, your device will have different performances playing an HEVC/H.265 video. If you have a high-end device that supports HEVC hardware decoder, you don’t need to do this at all. But if your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra struggles to play HEVC videos, you will need to convert them to a format that is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra first. That’s where an HEVC to Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra converter comes in.
