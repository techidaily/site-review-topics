    Does Motorola Moto G24 have native support for MKV files? As a matter of fact, most Android devices need to install a third party media player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, Mobo Player, etc.) to watch MKV content. If for some reason this method doesn’t work for you, you need to convert MKV files to a format that is compatible with Motorola Moto G24 prior, such as H.264 MP4.

    Because MKV isn’t an industry standard, not all portable devices support it - even though support has grown rapidly. You have two main options for playing MKV files on Motorola Moto G24: using an MKV compatible media player with appropriate codecs installed （e.g VLC player, MX Player）, or converting MKV files to the widely supported H.264 MP4 format if the first option doesn’t work. Check a quick guide on how to encode MKV files to H.264 MP4 for Motorola Moto G24 playback.
