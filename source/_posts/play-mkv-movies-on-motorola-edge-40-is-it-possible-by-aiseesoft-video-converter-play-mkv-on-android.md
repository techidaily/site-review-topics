description: MKV is a container format. If it holds a video or audio codec that is not supported by Motorola Edge 40, you will fail to play. In that case, we would recommend converting MKV to H.264 MP4 for Motorola Edge 40 playback.

  <p>
    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Motorola Edge 40 plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Motorola Edge 40.

  Video is laggy when playing 4K .mkv on my Motorola Edge 40
</div>
<div class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-question">
  “I'm using moboplayer to watch a 4K MKV show but the video is very laggy. I don't know if this is a software issue or the Motorola Edge 40 is simply not fast enough to run high quality videos. I read somewhere that converting the video will make it run smoother. Is this true? And if so how do I convert it and into what format? I would really appreciate any help.”
