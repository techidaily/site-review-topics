    Does Samsung Galaxy S23 have native support for MKV files? As a matter of fact, most Android devices need to install a third party media player (e.g. VLC player, MX player, Mobo Player, etc.) to watch MKV content. If for some reason this method doesn’t work for you, you need to convert MKV files to a format that is compatible with Samsung Galaxy S23 prior, such as H.264 MP4.

    Whether you are downloading videos from the Internet or getting them from your friends, there is a high chance that you will come across MKV files. MKV is  not an audio or video compression format, but a multimedia container format. An MKV container can incorporate audio, video, and subtitles into a single file - even if those elements use different types of encoding. For example, you could have an MKV file that contains H.264 or HEVC video and something like AAC, MP3 or AC3 for audio. If the MKV contains a video or audio codec that is not compatible with your Samsung Galaxy S23, you will need to convert them first for a smooth playback performance. This requires a good MKV to Samsung Galaxy S23 converter. The following guide explains how to convert MKV to H.264 MP4 for playing on Samsung Galaxy S23 smoothly.
