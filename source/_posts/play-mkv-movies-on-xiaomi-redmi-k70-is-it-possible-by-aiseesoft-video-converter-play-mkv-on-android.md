    Because MKV isn’t an industry standard, not all portable devices support it - even though support has grown rapidly. You have two main options for playing MKV files on Xiaomi Redmi K70: using an MKV compatible media player with appropriate codecs installed （e.g VLC player, MX Player）, or converting MKV files to the widely supported H.264 MP4 format if the first option doesn’t work. Check a quick guide on how to encode MKV files to H.264 MP4 for Xiaomi Redmi K70 playback.
