    MOV is an MPEG 4 video container file format used in Apple's QuickTime media software. Files that are saved in .mov format are compressed, making it easier to download and stream video from the Internet to your computer or portable media device. MOV files use Apple’s proprietary compression algorithm, being very popular in Apple products like QuickTime, iPhone, and iPad.
