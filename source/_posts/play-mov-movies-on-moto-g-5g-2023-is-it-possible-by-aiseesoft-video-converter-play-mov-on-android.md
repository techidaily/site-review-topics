  “Hi guys, I just changed for the Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) about half a month ago and I'm very pleased with it and don't regret leaving Apple, saving for iTunes compatibility. Anyways can anyone please tell me if there's a way I could play my .mov videos taken with my old iPhone on my Motorola Moto G 5G (2023)? Thanks.”

  Since Motorola Moto G 5G (2023) does not support playback of .MOV files using its stock player, you will need to install a third party media player that supports QuickTime MOV, or process file conversion before the playback. To download a .mov player for your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023), you can give VLC player, MX Player, BS Player and Mobo player a shot. To convert MOV files for viewing on Motorola Moto G 5G (2023), you can give Video Converter a shot. You load your MOV files to this Converter app, and choose H.264 MP4 as output format. This will ensure the converted files have a good playback performance on your Motorola Moto G 5G (2023).
