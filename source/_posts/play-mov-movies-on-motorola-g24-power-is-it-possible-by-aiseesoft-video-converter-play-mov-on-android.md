  “My client sent me some .mov files through an email the other day. He took them with his iPhone 8 plus. I click on them and they don’t play on my Motorola G24 Power. I installed MX Player and VLC player because many people say they will work. Unfortunately, there’s a no go. More suggestions or workarounds? Thanks in advance.”
