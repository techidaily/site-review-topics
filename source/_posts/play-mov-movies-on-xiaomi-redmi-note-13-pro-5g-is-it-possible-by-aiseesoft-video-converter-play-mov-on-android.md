  “Hi guys, I just changed for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G about half a month ago and I'm very pleased with it and don't regret leaving Apple, saving for iTunes compatibility. Anyways can anyone please tell me if there's a way I could play my .mov videos taken with my old iPhone on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G? Thanks.”
