description: MKV is a container format. If it holds a video or audio codec that is not supported by Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, you will fail to play. In that case, we would recommend converting MKV to H.264 MP4 for Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra playback.

    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

    If you’re like me, you’ll probably have several MKV videos in your Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. MKV is a container format. The stock player of Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra doesn’t support playing MKV files yet. Fortunately, such a problem is solved by using a third party media player app. My favorite choice for playing MKV files on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is VLC media player - mostly because it has built-in support and doesn’t require that you install anything else. But sadly this way doesn’t work all the time, especially when you try to play a .MKV file with high bitrates or high resolutions. In that case, I would recommend converting MKV to H.264 encoded MP4 first. This requires a helpful MKV to Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra converter. The following guide will walk you through how to do this via using such a converter app.
