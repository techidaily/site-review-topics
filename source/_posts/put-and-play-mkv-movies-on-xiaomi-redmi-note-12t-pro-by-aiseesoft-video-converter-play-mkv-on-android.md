    MKV is not a video or audio compression codec/format, but a container/wrapper that can hold many audio, video and subtitles streams, allowing the user to store a complete movie in a single file. This situation will result in Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro plays some of your MKV movies, but not the others. In this case, you may try to change the MKV files to H.264 MP4 videos before you copy them to your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro.

    Whether you are downloading videos from the Internet or getting them from your friends, there is a high chance that you will come across MKV files. MKV is  not an audio or video compression format, but a multimedia container format. An MKV container can incorporate audio, video, and subtitles into a single file - even if those elements use different types of encoding. For example, you could have an MKV file that contains H.264 or HEVC video and something like AAC, MP3 or AC3 for audio. If the MKV contains a video or audio codec that is not compatible with your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro, you will need to convert them first for a smooth playback performance. This requires a good MKV to Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro converter. The following guide explains how to convert MKV to H.264 MP4 for playing on Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro smoothly.
