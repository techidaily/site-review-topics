Microsoft Office applications are used by millions of people across the world on a daily basis. While knowing how to smartly work with Office tools like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint is something most users are aware of, dealing with issues like corruption in MS Office files is a totally different ball game. In this article, that’s what we’re focusing on.

## MS Office and Associated Problems

Creating a detailed travel plan, making a list of your monthly work assignments, calculating the total of hundreds of petty transactions, or designing a presentation for work, if you’ve ever done any of those using your computer, you’ve probably worked with MS Office. Word, Excel and PowerPoint have become household names thanks to their utility and ease-of-use. Technically sound as well as everyday home users know how to work with Office applications. The suite is reliable, easy to work around, and customizable.

_Now keep the good part aside for a few seconds and consider what happens if the files you create using Word / Excel / PowerPoint get damaged. It has happened to all of us. One day we save an Excel sheet after putting in hours of work only to discover that all of the data is appearing gibberish the next day. All that we’re left with is the thought – how did that happen?!_

The **reason behind** such a catastrophe is file corruption, and if you’re thinking why your Office files got corrupted while the system appears to be running just fine, here are a few questions that might aid your understanding:

1. Did your computer shut down abruptly due to a power surge while you were working with Office files?
2. Did you accidentally save a new file with the same name as another one without double-checking?
3. Did your Word / Excel / PowerPoint application throw some unexpected errors a few days before you faced the file corruption?
4. Have other files on the system become missing or damaged too?
5. Was the file that got corrupted overloaded with data?

If the answer to most of those questions was a ‘**Yes**’, no wonder your Office files got corrupted. In this case, the only way to regain access to all your data is to repair the file.

## How to Repair Office Documents (Word, Excel and PowerPoint)

Use one of the below-mentioned methods:

### <u>Open and Repair Functionality</u>

    - To repair corrupt PowerPoint files (.ppt / .pptx), launch MS PowerPoint

### <u>Remove Add-ins from Office Applications</u>

We often install add-ins to augment the functionality of our existing applications, but faulty or bugged add-ins can prove to be a pain. Office file corruption is one of the side-effects of messed up add-ins. Thus, removing them could be a solution to the issue.

1. Launch the particular Office program in safe mode. This will disable the working of all add-ins
2. Open the file in question and check its data. If it appears fine, a faulty add-in is where the real problem lies
3. One by one start enabling add-ins and reopening the file till you spot the bad one
