## How to Resolve 'Format error: not a PDF or corrupted' Error of PDF File

Sometimes while trying to open a PDF document you may encounter the following error message:

'**There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired**'

Due to the corruption of the PDF file, you become unable to view the multimedia and graphics contents of this PDF document. You only get to see the textual information or sometimes only a blank page appears on the screen. However, it is pretty much clear from the error itself that your PDF document is corrupt or damaged. Let us discuss the causes of the corruption of your PDF file:

**Causes of corruption -** Most common causes of PDF corruption are:

![](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/oxygen/48x48/actions/go-previous-rtl.png) Virus infection

![](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/oxygen/48x48/actions/go-previous-rtl.png) Incompatible third-party software interaction such as incompatible software to read or create a PDF file also corrupts it.

![](https://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/oxygen/48x48/actions/go-previous-rtl.png) Various other human errors like improper system shutdown, abrupt application abortion, erroneous download or upload of PDF file, etc. can also corrupt a PDF file.
