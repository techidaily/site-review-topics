    Many OnePlus 12R users feel depressed when all of their phone contacts have been erased after you factory reset phone, format SIM card or delete data accidentally. So is there any solution to recover contacts after factory reset OnePlus 12R?

    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" ><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted contacts, text messages, photos, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost contacts of OnePlus 12R will come back after your return.
