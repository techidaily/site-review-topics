  <ul class="tpl-content-sub-paragraph-ul-style">
    <li><strong>Accidental Deletion</strong> - Mistaken operation from users is one of the main reasons for deleting messages from your Honor Play 8T. For example, actions like pressing delete keys, emptying of recycle bin, improper use of command prompt, accidentally deleting while using third party application are part of reasons where we lose our messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Virus Attack</strong> - Some messages are deleted due to presence of virus in the system. Videos that are mostly saved using internet might contain virus, in such cases there is a threat of missing or deletion of messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Improper File Transfer</strong> - While transferring messages from one device to another, there are situations when media file is lost. It can’t be found in either of the storages. What’s more, use of 'ctrl+x' for transferring may lead to permanent deletion of files. </li>
    <li><strong>Formatting Error</strong> - A formatting error can give you hard time while connecting an external drive, SD card etc. to your computer. At such instances, there is a threat of loss of your messages from Honor Play 8T.</li>
