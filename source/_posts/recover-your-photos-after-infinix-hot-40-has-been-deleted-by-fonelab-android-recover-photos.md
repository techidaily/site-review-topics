  Lots of reasons may cause photos on Infinix Hot 40 lost or deleted, like Android update, device damaged, accidental deletion, factory reset and so on. What a frustrated thing it is when you accidentally delete some important photos especially when you realized that you didn't back up or synced your Infinix Hot 40 data frequently.

    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted photos, contacts, text messages, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost photos of Infinix Hot 40 will come back after your return.

        That’s all for how to recover deleted photos from Infinix Hot 40 with or without backups. If you still can’t find your deleted photos, it means they have been overwritten and cannot be recovered anymore.
