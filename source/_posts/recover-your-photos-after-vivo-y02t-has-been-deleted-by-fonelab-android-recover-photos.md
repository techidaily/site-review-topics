    As a matter of facts, a photo is marked as blank after being deleted. The deleted item just becomes inaccessible and invisible. However, it would be completely erased if new data are written in and take place of it.

    Therefore, you must stop adding new photos to your cell phone if data loss happens. There are ways to retrieve a deleted image on Vivo Y02T either from internal storage or SD card via Gmail or Android Data Recovery.

    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted photos, contacts, text messages, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost photos of Vivo Y02T will come back after your return.
