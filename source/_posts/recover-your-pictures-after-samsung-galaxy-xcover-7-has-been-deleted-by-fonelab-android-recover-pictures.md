    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" ><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted pictures, contacts, text messages, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost pictures of Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 will come back after your return.
